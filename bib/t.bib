  abstract = "We have designed a new eco-material for use in permeable
              pavements in view to ensuring the sustainable management of
              stormwater in urban areas. The specific characteristic of this
              material is that it allows the infiltration of rainfall, storing
              the infiltrated water and trapping the pollutants carried by
              runoff such as engine oil and heavy metals. This new material is
              composed of a mixture of crushed concrete , resulting from inert
              construction waste, and organic material (compost). We performed
              tracing experiments in view to monitor the flow of the water
              within this material in order to study its hydrodynamics under
              heavy rainfall (rain with a return period of 10 years). The
              experimental results revealed preferential flows due to the
              heterogeneity of the material and liable to act as a major vector
              for the mobility of the pollutants transported within the
              material by stormwater. The work presented in this article
              consists in quantifying these preferential flows by determining
              their water contents in mobile ($\vartheta$m) and immobile
              ($\vartheta$im) water during infiltration. To do this, we used
              the (NON-EQUILIBRIUM Convection--Dispersion Equation) model, in
              order to evaluate mobile and stagnant zones in the framework of
              tracing experiments. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",

  title    = "Greening the industrial city: equity, environment, and economic
              growth in Seattle and Chicago",
  author   = "McKendry, Corina and Janos, Nik",
  abstract = "In many cities of the global North, city leaders are using
              greening as a way to compete in the globalized economy. Critiques
              of this development strategy typically focus on downtown areas,
              and many have noted that such processes often displace poor and
              working class people. Less studied are those areas that have not
              been fully incorporated into the postindustrial economy and where
              the struggles around social justice, economic development, and
              ecological restoration are still being played out. It is this
              insufficiently informed area of knowledge which this paper seeks
              to address and as to which we ask: What has been the impact of
              the green economy discourse in relatively more marginalized urban
              areas? Using industrial areas of Southeast Chicago and South
              Seattle as case studies, this paper draws on previously
              unreported qualitative data to argue that community efforts to
              promote environmental justice in these areas have the potential
              to redefine practices of green economic growth to incorporate
              social equity and community coherence. However, their ability to
              do so is constrained by the difficulty in challenging neoliberal
              discourses of the primacy of growth and the need of greening to
              benefit the consumer class. The paper contemplates the
              implications of the lessons learnt for greening cities in both
              developed and developing countries. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",
