              20 years in the agro tourism field and also rural tourism, as
              well as in natural and cultivated pastures, at the Faculty of
              Agriculture and Horticulture, University of Craiova. Based on
              these studies it was concluded that the research in this field
              has been less realistic so far, because it was strictly oriented
              towards obtaining high forage production, but of questionable
              quality due to high content of residual chemicals. Currently, in
              tourism activities and other specific areas of food production,
              the demand for natural products (bio or eco) has greatly
              increased to ensure a quality taste and high security and
              traceability. To assist the forage manufacturers and workers in
              tourism activity we considered appropriate and necessary to study
              this particularly valuable forage, to which by applying minimal
              chemical treatments, high yields with a very low degree of
              chemical residues will be obtained, with a high nutritional
              quality and traceability, while a cuisine with higher value taste
              and food safety can be obtained. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

  abstract = "In the context of climatic uncertainty and potential climatic
              change, incorporating climatic variability and change in
              eco-hydrological analysis, as well as understanding the impact of
              such variability on ecosystems, is of crucial importance. The
              latter is particularly true for those complex ecosystems, such as
              wetlands, which cradle large varieties of species, many of which
              rare or endangered. Focusing on the Everglades wetlands, we
              investigate the presence of non-stationary elements in the
              seasonal cycle of precipitation, temperature and stage level and
              examine their correlation and potential impact on the ecosystem's
              flora and fauna. To this aim, we revisit demodulation techniques
              and demonstrate their validity for the diagnosis of long-term
              trends in the amplitude and phase of seasonal patterns of
              hydrologic series. We then analyse historical records of fauna
              and flora components of the Everglades in order to reveal
              potential relationships with hydrological trends. We observe that
              the seasonal patterns of all the time series analysed are
              non-stationary. In addition, we observe that the amplitude of
              seasonal oscillations of all hydro-climatic drivers is strongly
              correlated with anomalies in records of wading birds population
              and plant carbon assimilation. Copyright \copyright{} 2014 John
