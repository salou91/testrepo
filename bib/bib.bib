              occurrence of Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) and
              other antimicrobial-resistant organisms often include advice about
              screening patients coming from hospitals with a known resistance
              problem, to prevent introductions into new hospitals by shared
              patients. We argue that, despite being an efficient method of
              identifying cases, admission screening for introduction prevention
              is only effective if the absolute number of imported cases from
              other hospitals outnumbers the cases coming from the hospital’s
              own patient population, and therefore is only a feasible control
              strategy during the start of an epidemic. \#\#\# Competing

  abstract  = "Viruses interact with the intracellular transport machinery to
               promote viral replication. Such host-virus interactions can drive
               host gene adaptation, leaving signatures of pathogen-driven
               evolution in host genomes. Here, we leverage these genetic
               signatures to identify the dynein activating adaptor, ninein-like
               (NINL), as a critical component in the antiviral innate immune
               response and as a target of viral antagonism. Unique among genes
               encoding components of active dynein complexes, NINL has evolved
               under recurrent positive (diversifying) selection, particularly
               in its carboxy-terminal cargo-binding region. Consistent with a
               role for NINL in host immunity, we demonstrate that NINL knockout
               cells exhibit an impaired response to interferon, resulting in
               increased permissiveness to viral replication. Moreover, we show
               that proteases encoded by diverse picornaviruses and
               coronaviruses cleave and disrupt NINL function in a host- and
               virus-specific manner. Our work reveals the importance of NINL in
               the antiviral response and the utility of using signatures of
               host-virus genetic conflicts to uncover new components of
               antiviral immunity and targets of viral antagonism.",
