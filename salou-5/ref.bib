  abstract  = "There has been growing interest in the potential use of bovine
               milk as an exercise beverage, especially during recovery from
               resistance training and endurance sports. Based on the limited
               research, milk appears to be an effective post-resistance
               exercise beverage that results in favourable acute alterations
               in protein metabolism. Milk consumption acutely increases muscle
               protein synthesis, leading to an improved net muscle protein
               balance. Furthermore, when post-exercise milk consumption is
               combined with resistance training (12 weeks minimum), greater
               increases in muscle hypertrophy and lean mass have been
               observed. Although research with milk is limited, there is some
               evidence to suggest that milk may be an effective post-exercise
               beverage for endurance activities. Low-fat milk has been shown
               to be as effective, if not more effective, than commercially
               available sports drinks as a rehydration beverage. Milk
               represents a more nutrient dense beverage choice for individuals
               who partake in strength and endurance activities, compared to
               traditional sports drinks. Bovine low-fat fluid milk is a safe
               and effective post exercise beverage for most individuals,
               except for those who are lactose intolerant. Further research is
               warranted to better delineate the possible applications and
               efficacy of bovine milk in the field of sports nutrition.",

  abstract  = "Numerous studies have used a J-shaped or U-shaped curve to
               describe the relationship between alcohol use and total
               mortality. The nadir of the curves based on recent meta-analysis
               suggested optimal benefit at approximately half a drink per day.
               Fewer than 4 drinks per day in men and fewer than 2 per day in
               women appeared to confer benefit. Reductions in cardiovascular
               death and nonfatal myocardial infarction were also associated
               with light to moderate alcohol intake. Although some studies
               suggested that wine had an advantage over other types of
               alcoholic beverages, other studies suggested that the type of
               drink was not important. Heavy drinking was associated with an
               increase in mortality, hypertension, alcoholic cardiomyopathy,
               cancer, and cerebrovascular events, including cerebrovascular
               hemorrhage. Paradoxically, light-to-moderate alcohol use
               actually reduced the development of heart failure and did not
               appear to exacerbate it in most patients who had underlying
               heart failure. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain
               the benefit that light-to-moderate alcohol intake has on the
               heart, including an increase of high-density lipoprotein
               cholesterol, reduction in plasma viscosity and fibrinogen
               concentration, increase in fibrinolysis, decrease in platelet
               aggregation, improvement in endothelial function, reduction of
               inflammation, and promotion of antioxidant effects. Controversy
               exists on whether alcohol has a direct cardioprotective effect
               on ischemic myocardium. Studies from our laboratory do not
               support the concept that alcohol has a direct cardioprotective
               effect on ischemic/reperfused myocardium. Perhaps the time has
               come for a prospectively randomized trial to determine whether 1
               drink per day (or perhaps 1 drink every other day) reduces
               mortality and major cardiovascular events.",

              drinking motives and their relation to possible consequences over
              the last 15 years. To this end, a computer-assisted search of
              relevant articles was conducted. Results revealed that most young
              people reported drinking for social motives, some indicated
              enhancement motives, and only a few reported coping motives.
              Social motives appear to be associated with moderate alcohol use,
              enhancement with heavy drinking, and coping motives with
              alcohol-related problems. However, an enormous heterogeneity was
              found in terms of how motives were measured: 10 to 40 items were
              grouped into between 2 and 10 dimensions and sometimes the same
              items occurred under different dimensions. Future studies should

               individuals to overestimate the frequency with which uncertain
               cues are followed by negative outcomes, an example of
               covariation bias. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging,
               we found that uncertainty-related expectations modulated neural
               responses to aversion. Insula and amygdala responses to aversive
               pictures were larger after an uncertain cue (that preceded
               aversive or neutral pictures) than a certain cue (that always
               preceded aversive pictures). Anticipatory anterior cingulate
               cortex (ACC) activity elicited by the cues was inversely
               associated with the insula and amygdala responses to aversive
               pictures following the cues. Nearly 75\% of subjects
               overestimated the frequency of aversive pictures following
               uncertain cues, and ACC and insula activity predicted this
               uncertainty-related covariation bias. Findings provide the first

              One share-one vote maximizes the importance of benefits to
              securityholders relative to benefits to the controlling party and
              hence encourages the selection of an efficient management team.
