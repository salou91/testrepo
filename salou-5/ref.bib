  abstract = "This article reviews evidence of adolescent and young adult
              drinking motives and their relation to possible consequences over
              the last 15 years. To this end, a computer-assisted search of
              relevant articles was conducted. Results revealed that most young
              people reported drinking for social motives, some indicated
              enhancement motives, and only a few reported coping motives.
              Social motives appear to be associated with moderate alcohol use,
              enhancement with heavy drinking, and coping motives with
              alcohol-related problems. However, an enormous heterogeneity was
              found in terms of how motives were measured: 10 to 40 items were
              grouped into between 2 and 10 dimensions and sometimes the same
              items occurred under different dimensions. Future studies should
              therefore use well-defined, theoretically based, homogenous
              instruments to disentangle cultural from measurement differences
              across surveys.",
