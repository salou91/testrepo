  abstract = "AIM: Existing literature links poor sleep and anxiety symptoms in
              adolescents. This pilot study aimed to develop a practical method
              through which a program to improve sleep could reach adolescents
              in need and to examine the feasibility of a mindfulness-based,
              multi-component group sleep intervention using sleep and anxiety
              as outcome measures. METHODS: Sixty-two grade 9 students (aged
              13-15) at a girls' school were screened with the Pittsburgh Sleep
              Quality Index (PSQI) and Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS).
              Ten participants with self-reported poor sleep were enrolled into
              a six-session program based on Bootzin \& Stevens, with added
              stress/anxiety-specific components. Sessions covered key aspects
              of basic mindfulness concepts and practice, sleep hygiene, sleep
              scheduling, evening/daytime habits, stimulus control, skills for
              bedtime worries and healthy attitudes to sleep. Treatment changes
              were measured by pre-post scores on the PSQI, SCAS and 7-day
              actigraphy-measured sleep. RESULTS: The program demonstrated high
              acceptability, with a completion rate of 90\%. Based on
              effect-size analysis, participants showed significant improvement
              on objective sleep onset latency (SOL), sleep efficiency and
              total sleep time; actigraphy data also showed significantly
              earlier bedtime, rise time and smaller day-to-day bedtime
              variation. Post-intervention global PSQI scores were
              significantly lower than that of pre-intervention, with
              significant improvement in subjective SOL, sleep quality and
              sleep-related daytime dysfunction. There were small improvements
              on some subscales of the SCAS, but change on its total score was
              minimal. CONCLUSIONS: A mindfulness-based, multi-component,
              in-school group sleep intervention following brief screening is
              feasible, and has the potential to improve sleep. Its impact on
              anxiety needs further investigation.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Some women find hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS)
              to interfere more in daily life and mood than others.
              Psychological resources may help to explain these individual
              differences. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of
              self-compassion, defined as healthy way of relating toward the
              self when dealing with difficult experiences, as a potential
              moderator of the relationship between HFNS and daily life
              activities, which in turn influences symptoms of depression.
              STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study using
              questionnaire data from 206 women aged 40-60 who were currently
              experiencing hot flushes and/or night sweats. Path analysis was
              used to model relationships among menopausal factors (HFNS
              frequency and daily interference ratings), self-compassion and
              mood. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Hot flush interference in daily
              activities and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: On average, women
              experienced 4.02 HFNS per day, and HFNS frequency was moderately
              correlated with interference ratings (r=0.38). In the path
              analytic model, self-compassion made significant direct
              contribution to hot flush interference ratings ($\beta$=-0.37)
              and symptoms of depression ($\beta$=-0.42), and higher
              self-compassion was associated with lower interference and
              depressive symptoms. Self-compassion also moderated the
              relationship between HFNS frequency and hot flush interference.
              Higher self-compassion was associated with weaker effects of HFNS
              frequency on daily interference. CONCLUSIONS: Self-compassion may
              weaken the association between HFNS and daily life functioning,
              which in turn, could lead to less HFNS-related mood problems.
              These findings imply that self-compassion may be a resilience
              factor to help women manage hot flushes and night sweats.",

              Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire at Time-E. Daily actigraphy
              bedtime, rise-time, time-in-bed, total sleep time, sleep onset

                   means, a growing body of literature demonstrates the value
                   of considering differences in intra-individual variability.
                   Compared to the number of methods available for analyzing
                   mean differences, there is a paucity of methods available
                   for analyzing intra-individual variability, particularly
                   when variability is treated as a predictor. In the present
                   article, we first reviewed methods of analyzing
                   intra-individual variability as an outcome, including the
                   individual standard deviation (ISD) and some recent methods.
                   We then introduced a novel Bayesian method for analyzing
                   intra-individual variability as a predictor. To make this
                   method easily accessible to the research community, we
                   developed an open source R package, VARIAN. To compare the
                   accuracy of parameter estimates using the proposed Bayesian
                   analysis against the ISD as a predictor in a regression, we
                   carried out a simulation study. We then demonstrated, using
                   empirical data, how the estimated intra-individual
                   variability derived from the proposed Bayesian analysis can
                   be used to answer the following two questions: (1) is
                   intra-individual variability in daily time-in-bed associated
                   with subjective sleep quality? (2) does subjective sleep
                   quality mediate the association between time-in-bed
                   variability and depressive symptoms? We concluded with a
                   discussion of methodological and practical considerations
                   that can help guide researchers in choosing methods for

              A cognitive model of the relationships among objective sleep,
              subjective sleep, and negative mood was tested across these
              periods, with sleep-specific (i.e., dysfunctional beliefs and
              attitudes about sleep) and global (i.e., dysfunctional attitudes)
              cognitive vulnerabilities as moderators. DESIGN: Longitudinal

              2-w vacation (Time-V), and the first week of the next term

              adolescents, 47.3\% male, mean age =16.2 years (standard
              deviation +/- 1 year). INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND
              RESULTS: Objective sleep was measured continuously by actigraphy.
              Sociodemographics and cognitive vulnerabilities were assessed at
              Time-E; subjective sleep, negative mood (anxiety and depressive
              symptoms), and academic stress were measured at each time point.
              Controlling for academic stress and sex, subjective sleep quality
              mediated the relationship between objective sleep and negative
              mood at all time points. During extended (Time-V), but not
              restricted (Time-E and Time-S) sleep opportunity, this mediation
              was moderated by global cognitive vulnerability, with the
              indirect effects stronger with higher vulnerability. Further, at
              Time-E and Time-V, but not Time-S, greater sleep-specific and
              global cognitive vulnerabilities were associated with poorer
              subjective sleep quality and mood, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
              Results highlighted the importance of subjective sleep perception
              in the development of sleep related mood problems, and supported
              the role of cognitive vulnerabilities as potential mechanisms in
              the relationships between objective sleep, subjective sleep, and
              negative mood. Adolescents with higher cognitive vulnerability

  abstract = "Introduction: It is well established that for adolescents, school
              days are associated with sleep restriction, and that insufficient
              sleep has been linked to mood disturbances. This longitudinal
              study assessed sleep, mood, and life stress over the school term
              and vacation periods with restricted and extended sleep
              opportunities. The relationships between objective and subjective
              sleep, as well as between sleep and mood were examined. A
              cognitive model was proposed and tested to assess whether
              sleep-specific (i.e., dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about
              sleep) and global (i.e., dysfunctional attitudes) cognitive
              vulnerabilities played a role in these relationships. Methods:
              One-hundred and forty-six adolescents (47.3\% male) aged
              16.2+/-1.0 years (M+/-SD) from the general community wore an
              actigraph continuously for four weeks: the last week of a school
              term (Time-E), the following two-week vacation (Time-V), and the
              first week of the next term (Time-S). Social demographic
              information, chronotype, and cognitive vulnerabilities were
              assessed at Time-E. Subjective sleep, symptoms of depression,
              anxiety, and life stress were repeatedly measured at Time-E,
              Time-V, Time-S, and the middle of the subsequent school term.
              Regression analyses were used to explore the relationship between
              sleep and mood, and structural equation modelling was used to
              examine changes of variables over time, as well as the moderating
              roles of cognitive vulnerabilities. Results: Compared with school
              days, sleep during the vacation was characterized by later
              timing, longer duration, lower quality and greater variability.
              Daily changes in actigraphy- measured sleep over the vacation
              period showed linear delays in sleep timing throughout the
              vacation, while changes in time-in-bed were non-significant. The
              first vacation week was characterized by a linear decrease in
              total sleep time and sleep quality, and these changes stabilized
              during the second vacation week. Compared to vacations, school
              terms were associated with higher symptoms of depression,
              anxiety, and life stress. Poorer sleep quality, particularly
              poorer subjective perception of sleep quality, was significantly
              associated with higher symptoms of depression and anxiety. Sleep-
              specific cognitive vulnerability moderated the relationship
              between objective and subjective sleep onset latency during
              extended but not restricted sleep opportunity. After controlling
              for life stress, global cognitive vulnerability played different
              moderating roles in the relationship between subjective sleep and
              mood over school term and vacation periods. Higher global
              cognitive vulnerability was associated with a stronger
              relationship between subjective sleep and symptoms of anxiety
              (but not depression) during the school term, as well as with a
              stronger relationship between subjective sleep and symptoms of
              depression (but not anxiety) during the vacation period.
              Conclusion: Sleep, mood, and life stress changed markedly over
              the school term and vacation periods. Changes in sleep over the
              vacation suggested that the recovery from school- related sleep
              restriction was completed within two weeks' extended sleep
              opportunity, and the average sleep duration over this period
              suggested that sleep requirements in adolescence may be less than
              conventionally described in the media and in the scientific
              literature. Cognitive vulnerabilities played important roles in
              the relationship between sleep and mood. Adolescents with higher
              cognitive vulnerability might be more emotionally vulnerable
              towards school-related sleep restriction. These findings have
              important implications for future studies, as well as practical
              implications for policies and interventions designed to improve
              adolescents' wellbeing.",

              .20-.39), followed by beliefs about control ($\beta$ range:
              .16-.20) and interference ratings ($\beta$ range: .17-.26).
              CONCLUSIONS: Psychological aspects of the menopause appear more
              strongly linked to well-being than physiological aspects such as
              menopausal stage and hot flush frequency. Specifically,
              self-compassion, feeling in control of menopause and low
              interference ratings are three factors that are associated with
              well-being among midlife women. These aspects could be considered
              in tandem, as a means to support well-being in the context of
              menopause.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Depression is recognised as an independent
              cardiovascular risk factor in adults. Identifying this
              relationship early on in life is potentially important for the
              prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study
              investigated whether clinical depression is associated with
              multiple physiological markers of CVD risk in adolescents from
              the general community. METHODS: Participants aged 12-18 years
              were recruited from the general community and screened for
              depressive symptoms. Individuals with high and low depressive
              symptoms were administered a diagnostic interview. Fifty
              participants, 25 with a current depressive episode and 25 matched
              healthy controls, subsequently completed cardiovascular
              assessments. Variables assessed were automatic brachial and
              continuous beat-to-beat finger arterial blood pressure, heart
              rate, vascular functioning by pulse amplitude tonometry following
              reactive hyperaemia and pulse transit time (PTT) at rest. Blood
              samples were collected to measure cholesterol, glucose and
              glycohaemoglobin levels and an index of cumulative risk of
              traditional cardiovascular risk factors was calculated. RESULTS:
              Depressed adolescents had a significantly lower reactive
              hyperaemia index and shorter PTT, suggesting deterioration in
              vascular integrity and structure. Higher fasting glucose and
              triglyceride levels were also observed in the depressed group,
              who also had higher cumulative risk scores indicative of
              increased engagement in unhealthy behaviours and higher
              probability of advanced atherosclerotic lesions. LIMITATIONS: The
              sample size and number of males who completed all cardiovascular
              measures was small. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically depressed adolescents
              had poorer vascular functioning and increased CVD risk compared
              to controls, highlighting the need for early identification and
              intervention for the prevention of CVD in depressed youth.",

               intraindividual variability (IIV). The existing literature
               focuses on the means, while the nature and correlates of
               sleep/wake IIV are not well understood. A systematic search of
               records in five major databases from inception to November 2014
               identified 53 peer-reviewed empirical publications that examined
               correlates of sleep/wake IIV in adults. Overall, this literature
               appeared unsystematic and post hoc, with under-developed
               theoretical frameworks and inconsistent methodologies.
               Correlates most consistently associated with greater IIV in one
               or more aspects of sleep/wake patterns were: younger age,
               non-White race/ethnicity, living alone, physical health

               unipolar depression symptomatology, stress, and evening

               interventions. The effects of experimentally reduced sleep/wake

               current understanding of sleep/wake patterns beyond the mean

               when sleep is examined across multiple days. Theoretical and
               methodological shortcomings in the existing literature, and
               opportunities for future research are discussed.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Attitudes to ageing exert a powerful influence on
              health and well-being, yet surprisingly little research has
              examined factors that contribute to the formation of these
              attitudes. The aim of this study was to consider the potential
              role of self-compassion in predicting attitudes to ageing, which
              in turn contribute to positive and negative mental well-being and
              self-reported health. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study
              using data from 517 midlife women aged between 40 and 60.
              Structural equation modelling was used to examine the
              relationships between self-compassion, three facets of attitudes
              to ageing and well-being outcomes. RESULTS: Together,
              self-compassion and attitudes to ageing explained between 36\%
              and 67\% of the variance in well-being. Self-compassion was a
              strong predictor of attitudes towards psychosocial loss, physical
              change and psychological growth ($\beta$ range: .22-.51).
              Furthermore, the relationship between self-compassion and
              well-being outcomes was partially mediated by attitudes to
              physical change. CONCLUSION: Self-compassion may be a modifiable
              internal resource to promote healthy attitudes to ageing in
              midlife, when ageing becomes personally relevant. Moreover,
              attitudes towards physical change may help explain how

              (63.5\% female, mean age 15.78 years, range 11.92-19.67 years) in
              grades 7-12 from 11 secondary schools in metropolitan Melbourne,

              significantly mediated the relationship between age and
              depressive symptoms. Poor sleep quality also significantly
              mediated this relationship when sleep quality was defined by

              nocturnal indicators of cardiovascular risk in depressed
              adolescent girls from the general community (13-18 years old; 11
              clinically depressed, eight healthy control). Continuous
              beat-to-beat finger arterial blood pressure and heart rate were
              monitored via Portapres and electrocardiogram, respectively.
              Cardiovascular data were averaged over each hour for the first 6
              h of sleep, as well as in 2-min epochs of stable sleep that were
              then averaged within sleep stages. Data were also averaged across
              2-min epochs of pre-sleep wakefulness and the first 5 min of
              continuous non-rapid eye movement sleep to investigate the blood
              pressure dipping response over the sleep-onset period. Compared

              entire night (P < 0.01), as well as during all sleep stages (P <

              across the sleep-onset period, but the groups did not differ in
              the rate of decline across the period. Higher blood pressure
              during sleep in depressed adolescent females suggests that
              depression has a significant association with cardiovascular

               before bedtime (BT) have been associated with poorer and shorter
               sleep in adolescents; however, less is known about other
               behaviors in relation to sleep. This study characterized a range
               of behaviors in the hour before bed (i.e., pre-BT behaviors
               [PBBs]) and examined their relationship with sleep parameters
               during school and vacation periods (i.e., restricted and
               extended sleep opportunities, respectively). Mechanistic roles
               of chronotype and cognitive presleep arousal (PSAcog) were also
               examined. METHODS: During the last week of a school term and
               throughout a 2-week vacation, 146 adolescents (47.26\% male, age
               M $\pm$ standard deviation = 16.2 $\pm$ 1.0 years) from the
               general community completed daily sleep measure using
               actigraphy, self-report measures on PBBs and PSAcog (Presleep
               Arousal Scale) for both school and vacation periods, and
               chronotype (Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire). RESULTS:
               Adolescents engaged in a variety of behaviors before bed.
               Notably, playing video games was associated with significantly
               later school and vacation BT and shorter school sleep duration
               (controlling for chronotype). During vacation, online social
               media was associated with significantly longer sleep onset
               latency, and this relationship was mediated by higher PSAcog. In
               contrast, on school nights, spending time with family was
               associated with significantly earlier BT and longer sleep
               duration. CONCLUSIONS: Technology-related PBBs video games and
               online social media were risk factors for shorter and poorer
               sleep, whereas time with family was protective of sleep
               duration. In addressing sleep problems in adolescents,
               therapeutic procedures that target the potentially addictive
               nature of technology use and reduce PSAcog were implicated.",

  abstract  = "Research on the relationship between habitual sleep patterns and
               memory performance in older adults is limited. No previous study
               has used objective and subjective memory measures in a large,
               older-aged sample to examine the association between sleep and
               various domains of memory. The aim of this study was to examine
               the association between objective and subjective measures of
               sleep with memory performance in older adults, controlling for
               the effects of potential confounds. One-hundred and
               seventy-three community-dwelling older adults aged 65-89 years
               in Victoria, Australia completed the study. Objective sleep
               quality and length were ascertained using the Actiwatch 2
               Mini-Mitter, while subjective sleep was measured using the
               Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Memory was indexed by tests of
               retrospective memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised),
               working memory (n-back, 2-back accuracy) and prospective memory
               (a habitual button pressing task). Compared with normative data,
               overall performance on retrospective memory function was within
               the average range. Hierarchical regression was used to determine
               whether objective or subjective measures of sleep predicted
               memory performances after controlling for demographics, health
               and mood. After controlling for confounds, actigraphic sleep
               indices (greater wake after sleep onset, longer sleep-onset
               latency and longer total sleep time) predicted poorer
               retrospective (∆R(2) = 0.05, P = 0.016) and working memory
               (∆R(2) = 0.05, P = 0.047). In contrast, subjective sleep indices
               did not significantly predict memory performances. In
               community-based older adults, objectively-measured, habitual
               sleep indices predict poorer memory performances. It will be
               important to follow the sample longitudinally to determine
               trajectories of change over time.",

  abstract = "Sleep complaints are common in women, and women are more likely
              to suffer from insomnia than men. Multiple factors across a
              woman's lifespan, including hormonal changes, age-related
              physiological changes, psychosocial factors, the presence of
              sleep disorders, and physical and mental health conditions, can
              contribute to complaints of poor sleep in women. This article
              reviews the literature on the characteristics of, and
              contributing factors to, subjectively and objectively measured
              sleep during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and post-partum
              period, as well as the menopausal transition and postmenopause.
              Evidence from both subjective and objective measurements supports
              the presence of chronic sleep fragmentation associated with
              pregnancy, acute sleep deprivation during labour and the
              immediate post-partum periods, as well as disrupted sleep during
              the first few months after childbirth. While there is evidence
              for menstrual cycle and menopause related sleep disturbance based
              on women's self report, findings from objectively measured sleep
              have been mixed. Observational and intervention studies on the
              relationship between sleep and women's psychological well-being
              suggest that underlying causes of sleep disturbance across a
              woman's lifespan are often multi-factorial. Comprehensive
              assessments and targeted interventions are needed in managing
              sleep problems in women. Cognitive behavioural interventions have
              been shown to reduce sleep complaints during the perinatal and
              menopausal periods, and improvements in sleep are likely to lead
              to improvements in women's overall well-being.",

              Annette L",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Allostatic load (AL) represents cumulative
              wear-and-tear on the body and is operationalized as a multisystem
              index of biomarkers. Allostatic load is associated with
              morbidities and mortality, leading to a growing body of
              literature that uses AL as an outcome in its own right.
              Psychosocial resources (PSRs), such as mastery and social
              support, may influence health outcomes in part via AL, and the
              current review seeks to characterize the relations between PSRs
              and AL. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted by searching
              PubMed, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Embase for studies
              examining the relation between PSR(s) and AL in humans. From
              1,417 abstracts screened, 60 full-text articles were reviewed,
              and 24 studies met inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Mixed evidence
              exists for a relationship between PSRs and AL. Most (14/24)
              studies used a cross-sectional design, and only one study
              investigated whether a PSR predicted change in AL. Compared to
              cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies were more likely to
              report a significant relationship (8/14 versus 8/10,
              respectively). Studies with statistically significant main or
              moderated effects had larger sample sizes than those reporting
              null effects. Whether a study reported a significant main or
              moderated relationship did not differ by whether psychological
              (8/11) or social (10/16) resources were assessed. CONCLUSIONS:
              Evidence for a relationship between PSRs and AL is equivocal, and
              obtained significant relationships are generally small in
              magnitude. Gaps in the current literature and directions for
              future research are discussed. Longitudinal studies are needed
              that repeatedly assess PSRs and AL.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbance is implicated in memory function
               across normal aging and neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore,
               there is mounting evidence to suggest that high levels of
               subjective memory decline (SMD) may signal very early
               neurodegenerative changes associated with Alzheimer's disease
               (AD). This view prompts research examining the relationship
               between SMD and other risk factors for cognitive decline,
               including sleep disturbance. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether
               objective and subjective indices of sleep predict SMD in older
               adults. METHODS: 181 community-based older adults were divided
               into groups of high and low SMD based on their responses to the
               Memory Assessment Complaint Questionnaire (MAC-Q). They
               undertook two weeks of objective sleep monitoring (actigraphy),
               and completed a subjective sleep quality assessment using the
               Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. RESULTS: Hierarchical logistic
               regression indicated that after controlling for demographics and
               mood, objective sleep quality predicted high SMD group status
               ($\Delta$Nagelkerke R2 = 0.07, $\chi$2 = 9.80 (3), p = 0.020),
               while subjective sleep quality did not. Contrary to expectation,
               however, less sleep disruption predicted high SMD. CONCLUSION:
               These unexpected results may suggest a non-linear trajectory
               between sleep and memory decline in aging. The findings are
               discussed in relation to previous research, which taken
               together, may indicate compensatory sleep patterns of reduced
               sleep disruption in people with high levels of SMD. These
               preliminary findings suggest the utility of including analysis
               of sleep behavior in further longitudinal research of this
               at-risk group of older people.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Inadequate sleep independently influences eating
              habits and weight status. However, the relationship between these
              three factors has not been well quantified. The objective of this
              study was to examine if eating behavior (i.e. dietary restraint,
              disinhibition and hunger) mediates the relationship between sleep
              and body mass index (BMI) in a large sample of American adults.
              METHOD: Cross-sectional data from the Nathan Kline Institute
              Rockland sample were assessed (n = 602; 38.9 $\pm$ 14.5 years).
              Self-reported sleep and eating behavior were measured using the
              Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Three Factor Eating
              Questionnaire, respectively. Path analysis was used to examine
              relationships amongst the construct, with mediation tested via
              bootstrapped confidence intervals. RESULTS: Poorer sleep quality
              was associated with both greater hunger (P = 0.03) and higher
              disinhibited eating (overeating in the presence of palatable
              foods or other disinhibiting stimuli like emotional stress; P <
              0.001) behaviors. Higher disinhibited eating behavior was also
              associated with higher BMI (P < 0.001). There was a significant
              indirect relationship between sleep quality and BMI via
              disinhibition (b [95\% CI] = 0.13 [0.06, 0.21], P = 0.001). No
              significant effects were found when total sleep time or time in
              bed were replaced as predictors in the mediation model.
              CONCLUSION: Disinhibited eating behavior mediated the
              relationship between sleep quality and weight status in both
              males and females. This mediation was due to aspects of sleep
              quality other than duration. These results suggest that improving
              sleep quality may benefit weight loss by helping to reduce an
              individuals' susceptibility to overeating.",

              subjective sleepiness. Forty adults (22 females, aged 19-39

              total sleep deprivation (last test session at 60 h), and 2 nights
              of 8 h recovery sleep. An arithmetic task (MATH) with three
              difficulty levels assessed working memory. The Psychomotor
              Vigilance Task assessed sustained attention. Arithmetic accuracy
              and Psychomotor Vigilance Task median reaction time measured
              objective performance. Subjective performance was measured with
              self-reported accuracy and speed. Objective-subjective
              differences assessed self-monitoring ability. The performance on
              both tasks declined during total sleep deprivation and improved

              accurately self-monitored performance on the Psychomotor

              MATH, self-reporting performance as worse than actually observed.
              Following recovery, participants overestimated the extent of
              performance improvement on the Psychomotor Vigilance Task. Task
              difficulty influenced self-monitoring ability, with greater

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Insomnia and major depressive disorders (MDD) often
              co-occur, and such comorbidity has been associated with poorer
              outcomes for both conditions. However, individual differences in
              depressive symptom trajectories during and after treatment are
              poorly understood in comorbid insomnia and depression. This study
              explored the heterogeneity in long-term depression change
              trajectories, and examined their correlates, particularly
              insomnia-related characteristics. METHOD: Participants were 148
              adults (age M $\pm$ SD = 46.6 $\pm$ 12.6, 73.0\% female) with
              insomnia and MDD who received antidepressant pharmacotherapy, and
              were randomized to 7-session Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for
              Insomnia or control conditions over 16 weeks with 2-year
              follow-ups. Depression and insomnia severity were assessed at
              baseline, biweekly during treatment, and every 4 months
              thereafter. Sleep effort and beliefs about sleep were also
              assessed. RESULTS: Growth mixture modeling revealed three
              trajectories: (a) Partial-Responders (68.9\%) had moderate
              symptom reduction during early treatment (p value < .001) and
              maintained mild depression during follow-ups. (b)
              Initial-Responders (17.6\%) had marked symptom reduction during
              treatment (p values < .001) and low depression severity at
              posttreatment, but increased severity over follow-up (p value <
              .001). (c) Optimal-Responders (13.5\%) achieved most gains during
              early treatment (p value < .001), continued to improve (p value <
              .01) and maintained minimal depression during follow-ups. The
              classes did not differ significantly on baseline measures or
              treatment received, but differed on insomnia-related measures
              after treatment began (p values < .05): Optimal-Responders
              consistently endorsed the lowest insomnia severity, sleep effort,
              and unhelpful beliefs about sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Three depression
              symptom trajectories were observed among patients with comorbid
              insomnia and MDD. These trajectories were associated with
              insomnia-related constructs after commencing treatment. Early
              changes in insomnia characteristics may predict long-term
              depression outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record",

              fatigue among women seeking help for unsettled infant behaviours",
  author   = "Wilson, Nathan and Wynter, Karen and Fisher, Jane and Bei, Bei",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence in relatively healthy
              populations suggests that postpartum depression and fatigue are
              likely distinct but related experiences. However, differentiating
              depression and fatigue in clinical settings remains a challenge.
              This study aimed to assess if depression and fatigue are distinct
              constructs in women with relatively high fatigue and
              psychological distress symptoms attending a residential program
              that assists with unsettled infant behaviour. METHODS: 167 women
              (age: M = 34.26, SD = 4.23) attending a private residential early
              parenting program completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale
              (DASS21-D), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and self-report sleep
              variables before program commencement. Confirmatory Factor
              Analysis examined the associations between depression and fatigue
              latent factors. RESULTS: A two-factor model of separate but
              related depression and fatigue constructs provided a
              significantly better fit to the data than a one-factor model of
              combined depression and fatigue (p < .001). In the two-factor
              model, the depression and fatigue latent factors were moderately
              correlated (.41). Further predictive utility of this two-factor
              model was demonstrated as both depression and fatigue factors
              were independently predicted by worse self-reported sleep
              efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides empirical evidence
              that for women attending a clinical service with relatively high
              fatigue and psychological distress, postpartum depression and
              fatigue remain separate but related experiences. These findings
              suggest that in women seeking clinical support in the postpartum
              period, both depression and fatigue need to be carefully assessed
              to ensure accurate diagnoses, and (b) whilst depression
              intervention may improve fatigue, targeted fatigue intervention
              may also be warranted.",

  abstract = "A substantial number of women experience sleep difficulties in
              the approach to menopause and beyond, with 26\% experiencing
              severe symptoms that impact daytime functioning, qualifying them
              for a diagnosis of insomnia. Here, we review both self-report and
              polysomnographic evidence for sleep difficulties in the context
              of the menopausal transition, considering severity of sleep
              complaints and links between hot flashes (HFs) and depression
              with poor sleep. Longitudinal population-based studies show that
              sleep difficulties are uniquely linked with menopausal stage and
              changes in follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol, over and
              above the effects of age. A major contributor to sleep complaints
              in the context of the menopausal transition is HFs, and many,
              although not all, HFs are linked with polysomnographic-defined
              awakenings, with HF-associated wake time contributing
              significantly to overall wakefulness after sleep onset. Some
              sleep complaints may be comorbid with depressive disorders or
              attributed to sleep-related breathing or movement disorders,
              which increase in prevalence especially after menopause, and for
              some women, menopause, age, and environmental/behavioral factors
              may interact to disrupt sleep. Considering the unique and
              multifactorial basis for sleep difficulties in women
              transitioning menopause, we describe clinical assessment
              approaches and management options, including combination
              treatments, ranging from cognitive behavioral therapy for
              insomnia to hormonal and nonhormonal pharmacological options.
              Emerging studies suggest that the impact of severe insomnia
              symptoms could extend beyond immediate health care usage and
              quality of life issues to long-term mental and physical health,
              if left untreated in midlife women. Appropriate treatment,
              therefore, has immediate benefit as well as advantages for

              measures of sleep quality, and their associations with anxiety in
              adolescents with CFS/ME compared with healthy controls. METHODS:
              Twenty-one adolescents with CFS/ME aged 13 to 18 years (mean age
              15.57 $\pm$ 1.40), and 145 healthy adolescents aged 13 to 18
              years (mean age 16.2 $\pm$ 1.00) wore actigraphy watches

              variables. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to obtain
              a subjective measure of sleep quality. Anxiety was measured by
              the Spence Children's Anxiety scale. RESULTS: On average over the
              2-week period, adolescents with CFS/ME were found to have (1)
              significantly longer objective sleep onset latency, time in bed,

              postmenopausal women, age between 47 and 60 years, recruited from
              hospital menopause and gynecology clinics. The 4-week
              intervention consisted of weekly 2-hour sessions, and covered how
              memory works, memory changes related to ageing, health and
              lifestyle factors, and specific memory strategies. Memory
              contentment (CT), reported frequency of forgetting (FF), use of
              memory strategies, psychological distress, and attitude toward
              menopause were measured. A double-baseline design was applied,

              [T1] and in the first session [T2]), immediately postintervention
              (T3), and 3-month postintervention (T4). To describe changes in

              associated with membership of profile groups. BACKGROUND:
              Depression and anxiety are common among women with unsettled
              infants; less is known about other indicators of psychological
              distress and about maternal sleep. METHODS: Women admitted to a
              REPS during a 5-month period completed validated measures of
              depression, anxiety, stress, irritability, alcohol use, fatigue,
              sleepiness and sleep quality. Latent class analysis was used to
              identify symptom profiles. Factors significantly associated with
              class membership were identified. RESULTS: Surveys were completed
              by 167/380 women. Scores on all measures were statistically
              significantly poorer than community norms. Two classes were
              identified, characterised by high versus low psychological
              distress. Mean scores on measures of fatigue, sleepiness and
              sleep quality were high in both classes. High psychological
              distress was associated with having previous mental health
              problems and an unmet need for emotional support. CONCLUSION:
              Fatigue and poor sleep quality are universal among women admitted
              to REPS. Health services providing assistance with unsettled
              infant behaviour should include strategies to improve maternal
              sleep, and encourage social interaction among women to protect

              10-min visual Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT; subgroup of 47
              women). All measures were administered on both admission
              (baseline) and discharge. RESULTS: On admission, participants
              reported elevated sleep disturbance (94\%), fatigue (91\%), as
              well as trait (54\%) and state (67\%) sleepiness. From admission
              to discharge, there were medium effect size reductions in fatigue
              and sleepiness, and large effect size improvements in sleep
              quality related domains such as increased sleep efficiency and
              reduced nighttime awakenings (all p < 0.001); changes in total
              sleep time were nonsignificant (p = 0.22). PVT reciprocal mean
              reaction times were also significantly faster (p = 0.001; medium
              effect size). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that among
              women attending a brief residential early parenting program,
              fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and objectively measured psychomotor
              vigilance can be improved. Implications for further research and
              potential treatments are discussed.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: New parents are vulnerable to fatigue and depressive
              symptoms. Many studies have reported significant positive
              correlations between the two in postpartum parents, but the size
              of correlations varies considerably between studies. The
              relationship between postpartum fatigue and depression is yet to
              be systematically synthesized and meta-analyzed. METHODS: A
              PROSPERO registered systematic review and meta-analysis
              (CRD42017065240) was conducted on the correlation between fatigue
              and depression within the first two years postpartum in parents.
              Moderation analysis was used to examine the influence of
              demographic and measurement factors on the effect sizes. RESULTS:
              Thirty-five eligible papers were identified (34 on mothers, 1 on
              fathers). The meta-analytic summary effect size for
              simultaneously measured fatigue and depressive symptoms among
              women in the postpartum period was r = 0.52, 95\% CI [0.45,
              0.59], p < .001. There was a high degree of heterogeneity in the
              strength of the correlation between studies. This heterogeneity
              was not accounted for by demographic (e.g., infant age, maternal
              age, population type) or methodology (e.g., measurement) related
              moderators. LIMITATIONS: Studies not reporting or providing
              correlation between fatigue and depression were not included.
              Unable to assess some moderators due to limited sample size.
              CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong correlation between fatigue and
              depressive symptoms among women in the first two years after
              child-birth, but a high degree of heterogeneity in correlation
              strength exists between studies. Careful assessment of both
              fatigue and depression when either symptom is reported could
              facilitate accurate differential diagnosis and prioritizing
              treatment in postpartum women. Further implications for
              assessment, treatment, and future research are discussed.",

              (REPS) provide structured, psycho-educational programs for
              unsettled infant behaviour and associated maternal difficulties.
              Thus far, most studies have focused on the psychological
              functioning of women admitted to these services; few studies have
              investigated the mental health of their male partners and none
              have used standardised measures to assess alcohol use, fatigue,
              sleepiness, and sleep quality. The aim of this exploratory survey
              was to assess mental health problems, alcohol use, and
              sleep-related functioning among men whose partners and infants
              were admitted to a privately funded REPS. Method Male partners of
              women admitted to an REPS in Melbourne, Australia, during a
              5-month period completed surveys including self-report measures
              of depression, anxiety, stress, irritability, alcohol use,
              fatigue, sleepiness, and sleep quality. Surveys were completed by
              53 men; mean age was 36?years. Mean scores on standardised
              instruments were compared with normative or comparison data. The
              proportions of participants scoring in the clinical range on each

              irritability, fatigue, sleepiness, and sleep quality were
              significantly worse than norms for healthy adults. Fifty-one

              reported clinically significant fatigue and 82\% scored in the
              clinical range for poor sleep quality. Conclusions This study
              provides preliminary evidence that men whose partners are
              admitted to an REPS may have impaired psychological and
              sleep-related functioning, which might affect interactions with

  abstract = "STUDY OBJECTIVES: We previously presented results from a
              randomized controlled trial that examined the effects of
              antidepressant medication plus cognitive behavioral therapy for
              insomnia (CBT-I) among patients with major depressive disorder
              (MDD) and insomnia. The current secondary analysis aims to
              examine whether circadian preference moderated the reduction in
              depression and insomnia symptom severity during this trial.
              METHODS: A total of 139 adult participants with MDD and insomnia
              disorder were treated with antidepressant medication and
              randomized to receive 7 sessions of CBT-I or a control therapy
              (CTRL). Circadian preference (eveningness) was measured using the
              Composite Scale of Morningness (CSM). Depression symptom severity
              was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS);
              insomnia symptom severity was assessed using the Insomnia
              Severity Inventory (ISI). The moderating role of circadian
              preference on changes in HRSD and ISI was assessed via latent
              growth models within the framework of structural equation
              modeling. RESULTS: Greater evening preference was associated with
              smaller reduction in HDRS (P = .03) from baseline to week 6
              across treatment groups. The interaction between CSM and
              treatment group was also significant (P = .02), indicating that
              participants with greater evening preference in the CTRL group
              had significantly smaller HDRS reduction than those with greater
              evening preference in the CBT-I group. Circadian preference did
              not share significant associations with ISI (all P> .30).
              CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with MDD and insomnia who have an
              evening preference are at increased risk for poor response to
              pharmacological depression treatment augmented with either CBT-I
              or CTRL behavioral insomnia treatment. However, evening types
              have better depression outcomes when treated with CBT-I than with
              CTRL for insomnia.",

              therapy for insomnia during pregnancy. METHODS: Randomized,
              unmasked, 3-site controlled trial. Participants were randomly
              allocated to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (a
              first-line, empirically supported psychosocial intervention that
              addresses sleep-related behaviors and cognitions) or a control
              intervention consisting of imagery exercises that paired
              patient-identified distressing nighttime experiences with
              patient-identified neutral images. Participants were eligible if
              they met diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder and were
              between 18 and 32 weeks of gestation. Patients were ineligible if
              they met diagnostic criteria for major psychiatric disorders,
              including depression, or were receiving nonstudy treatments that
              could affect sleep (or both). The primary outcome was the
              Insomnia Severity Index score, a validated brief questionnaire,
              with scores between 14 and 21 representing clinically meaningful
              insomnia of moderate severity, scores higher than 21 representing
              severe insomnia, and scores less than 8 representing no insomnia.
              Secondary outcomes included remission of insomnia (Insomnia
              Severity Index score less than 8), objectively measured and
              self-reported time awake (ie, total wake time), and the Edinburgh
              Postnatal Depression Scale score. All outcomes were measured
              weekly. Analysis included 48 participants who did not complete
              treatment. We estimated that 184 women would be required to have
              80\% power, with a two-tailed test, to detect a moderate Cohen's
              d effect size (.5) with $\alpha$=.05. RESULTS: Between May 2013
              and April 2017, 194 pregnant women were randomized and 149
              completed treatment; 179 with available baseline data (92\%) were
              ultimately analyzed, 89 in the cognitive therapy group and 90 in
              the control group. Women assigned to cognitive behavioral therapy
              for insomnia experienced significantly greater reductions in
              insomnia severity (scores decreased from 15.4$\pm$4.3 to
              8.0$\pm$5.2 in the cognitive behavioral therapy group vs from
              15.9$\pm$4.4 to 11.2$\pm$4.9 in the control therapy group
              [P<.001, d=0.5]). Remission of insomnia (to an Insomnia Severity
              Index score less than 8) disorder was attained by 64\% of women
              in the cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia group vs 52\% in
              the control group. Women receiving cognitive behavioral therapy
              for insomnia experienced faster remission of insomnia disorder,
              with a median of 31 days vs 48 days in the control therapy
              (P<.001). Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia led to
              significantly greater reduction in self-reported but not
              objective total wake time and a small but significantly greater
              decline in Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores vs the
              control group. CONCLUSION: Cognitive behavioral therapy for

  abstract = "Study Objectives: Variable daily sleep (ie, higher
              intraindividual variability; IIV) is associated with negative
              health consequences, but potential physiological mechanisms are
              poorly understood. This study examined how the IIV of sleep
              timing, duration, and quality is associated with physiological
              dysregulation, with diurnal cortisol trajectories as a proximal
              outcome and allostatic load (AL) as a multisystem distal outcome.
              Methods: Participants are 436 adults (Mage $\pm$ standard
              deviation = 54.1 $\pm$ 11.7, 60.3\% women) from the Midlife in
              the United States study. Sleep was objectively assessed using
              7-day actigraphy. Diurnal cortisol was measured via saliva
              samples (four/day for 4 consecutive days). AL was measured using
              23 biomarkers from seven systems (inflammatory,
              hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, metabolic glucose and lipid,
              cardiovascular, parasympathetic, sympathetic) using a validated
              bifactor model. Linear and quadratic effects of sleep IIV were
              estimated using a validated Bayesian model. Results: Controlling
              for covariates, more variable sleep timing (p = .04 for risetime,
              p = .097 for bedtime) and total sleep time (TST; p = .02), but
              not mean sleep variables, were associated with flatter cortisol
              diurnal slope. More variable sleep onset latency and wake after
              sleep onset, later average bedtime, and shorter TST were
              associated with higher AL adjusting for age and sex (p-values <
              .05); after controlling for all covariates, however, only later
              mean bedtime remained significantly associated with higher AL (p
              = .04). Conclusions: In a community sample of adults, more
              variable sleep patterns were associated with blunted diurnal
              cortisol trajectories but not with higher multisystem
              physiological dysregulation. The associations between sleep IIV
              and overall health are likely complex, including multiple

              associated with delayed sleep and poor functional/mood outcomes.
              Currently, it is unknown whether irregular sleep contributes to
              poor functional/mood outcomes in individuals with Delayed
              Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD). METHODS: In 170 patients with
              DSWPD, we collected sleep-wake patterns, dim light melatonin
              onset (DLMO), and functional/mood outcomes. The Sleep Regularity
              Index (SRI) and other sleep timing metrics were computed.
              Correlations of SRI were computed with phase angle (difference
              between DLMO and desired bedtime), sleep timing and quality
              variables, daytime function, sleep-related daytime impairment,
              mood, and insomnia symptom severity. Path analyses assessed
              whether SRI or total sleep time mediated the associations between
              sleep onset time and phase angle with daytime functioning,
              sleep-related impairment, and mood outcomes. RESULTS: Higher SRI
              was associated with earlier sleep and longer total sleep time,
              but did not relate to sleep quality, daytime function, or mood
              outcomes. Path analysis showed that phase angle was directly
              associated with all outcome variables, whereas sleep onset time
              was not directly associated with any. SRI mediated the effects of
              sleep onset time and phase angle on daytime function. Total sleep
              time mediated the effects of sleep onset time and phase angle on
              sleep-related impairment. CONCLUSION: Individuals with DSWPD who
              have more delayed sleep and a greater phase angle also have more
              irregular sleep. This suggests that it is not delayed sleep
              timing per se that drives poor functional outcomes in DSWPD, but
              rather the timing of sleep relative to circadian phase and
              resultant irregular sleep patterns.",

  abstract = "Introduction: Research has extensively examined the relationship
              between adolescents' mental health and average sleep
              duration/quality. Using rigorous methodology, this study
              characterized adolescents' objective sleep intraindividual
              variability (IIV) and examined its role on mood beyond the
              effects of their respective individual mean (IIM) values. Aims
              and Methods: One hundred forty-six community-dwelling adolescents
              (47.3\% male) aged 16.2 $\pm$ 1.0 (M $\pm$ SD) years wore an
              actigraph that assessed bedtime, risetime, time-in-bed (TIB), and
              sleep onset latency (SOL) throughout a 15-day vacation with
              relatively unconstrained sleep opportunity. Self-report sleep
              quality (SSQ), negative mood (MOOD), and other covariates were
              assessed using questionnaires. For each sleep variable,
              individuals' mean values (IIM) and IIV were used to
              simultaneously predict MOOD with SSQ as a mediator. Models were
              estimated in a Bayesian IIV framework; both linear and quadratic
              effects of the IIM and IIV were examined. Results: Longer and
              more variable TIB, as well as more variable SOL (but not mean
              SOL), were associated with poorer SSQ (ps < .01), which in turn,
              was associated with more negative MOOD (ps < .05). The indirect
              effect of SOL IIV was curvilinear, such that as SOL became more
              variable, the deteriorating effect of high SOL IIV accelerated.
              Neither bedtime nor risetime IIV was significantly associated
              with SSQ or MOOD. Conclusions: During relatively unconstrained
              sleep opportunity, more variable TIB and SOL were associated with
              more negative mood, mediated by poorer perceived sleep quality.
              Significant effects of IIV were over and above that of mean
              values, suggesting that unique aspects of sleep IIV are relevant
              to how adolescents perceive sleep quality and their mood.",

              symptoms in the postpartum period. It is routine to screen for
              depressive symptoms, but anxiety, stress, fatigue, irritability
              and insomnia symptoms are less often assessed despite their
              prevalence. This study aimed to assess multiple dimensions of
              psychological distress, and their reliable change and clinically
              significant change among women admitted to a residential program
              for assistance with unsettled infant behaviors (UIB). METHOD:
              Women admitted to a five-night residential early parenting
              program completed self-report measures: the Depression Anxiety
              Stress Scale, Irritability Depression Anxiety Scale, Fatigue
              Severity Scale, and Insomnia Severity Index. A sub-group
              completed a computerized emotional Go-NoGo (EGNG) task as a
              measure of emotional impulsivity. RESULTS: Seventy-eight women
              were recruited (Mage = 34.46, SDage = 4.16). On admission, 48\%
              of women reported clinically elevated depressive symptoms and
              97.5\% of women not reporting elevated depressive symptoms
              reported clinical elevations in at least one other form of
              distress. Upon discharge, all self-report distress symptoms were
              significantly reduced (all p-values <.001), but reliable and
              clinically significant change only occurred in a subgroup of
              women. There were no significant changes in indicators of
              impulsivity based on the EGNG. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to, and
              often in the absence of, depressive symptoms, women attending an
              early parenting program experienced a wide range of psychological
              distress, including fatigue, insomnia, anxiety and stress.
              Different forms of distress improved in different magnitudes to
              the treatment provided. These findings highlight the need for a

              (CBT-I) has been shown to improve both sleep and depressive
              symptoms, but predictors of depression outcome following CBT-I
              have not been well examined. This study investigated how
              chronotype (i.e., morningness-eveningness trait) and changes in
              sleep efficiency (SE) were related to changes in depressive
              symptoms among recipients of CBT-I. METHODS: Included were 419
              adult insomnia outpatients from a sleep disorders clinic (43.20\%
              males, age mean $\pm$ standard deviation = 48.14 $\pm$ 14.02).
              All participants completed the Composite Scale of Morningness and
              attended at least 4 sessions of a 6-session group CBT-I. SE was
              extracted from sleep diary; depressive symptoms were assessed
              using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) prior to (Baseline),
              and at the end (End) of intervention. RESULTS: Multilevel
              structural equation modeling revealed that from Baseline to End,
              SE increased and BDI decreased significantly. Controlling for
              age, sex, BDI, and SE at Baseline, stronger evening chronotype
              and less improvement in SE significantly and uniquely predicted
              less reduction in BDI from Baseline to End. Chronotype did not
              predict improvement in SE. CONCLUSIONS: In an insomnia outpatient
              sample, SE and depressive symptoms improved significantly after a
              CBT-I group intervention. All chronotypes benefited from sleep
              improvement, but those with greater eveningness and/or less sleep
              improvement experienced less reduction in depressive symptom
              severity. This suggests that evening preference and insomnia
              symptoms may have distinct relationships with mood, raising the
              possibility that the effect of CBT-I on depressive symptoms could
              be enhanced by assessing and addressing circadian factors.",

               unclear. This study examined the temporal and bi-directional
               associations between stress and sleep, and explored the
               moderating role of baseline sleep complaints, using daily,
               intensive longitudinal designs. METHODS: Participants were 326
               young adults (Mage=23.24$\pm$5.46), providing >2,500 nights of
               sleep altogether. Prospective total sleep time (TST), sleep
               onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep
               efficiency (SE) were measured using actigraphy and sleep
               diaries. Perceived stress was reported three times daily
               between: 11:00-15:00, 15:30-19:30, and 20:00-02:00. Sleep
               complaints were measured at baseline using the PROMIS sleep
               disturbance scale. Within and between-person sleep and stress
               variables were tested using cross-lagged multilevel models.
               RESULTS: Controlling for covariates and lagged outcomes,
               within-person effects showed that higher evening stress
               predicted shorter actigraphic and self-reported TST (both
               p<.01). Conversely, shorter actigraphic and self-reported TST
               predicted higher next-day stress (both p<.001). Longer
               self-reported SOL and WASO (both p<.001), as well as lower
               actigraphic (p<.01) and self-reported SE (p<.001) predicted
               higher next-day stress. Between-person effects emerged only for
               self-reported TST predicting stress (p<.01). No significant
               results were found for the moderating role of baseline sleep
               complaints. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrated bi-directional
               relations between stress and sleep quantity, and a consistent
               direction of worse sleep quantity and continuity predicting
               higher next-day stress. Results highlighted within-individual

  abstract = "STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study explored the relationship between
              stress and actigraphy-measured and self-reported sleep in
              adolescents during periods of restricted (school) and
              unrestricted (vacation) sleep opportunities. We further examined
              whether (1) cognitive pre-sleep arousal (PSA) mediated the
              relationship between stress and sleep onset latency (SOL), and
              (2) coping moderated the effect of stress on PSA. METHODS:
              Participants were 146 (77 females) adolescents (M = 16.2, SD =
              1.0) recruited from the community. Actigraphy assessed daily
              sleep over the last week of a school-term and the following
              two-week vacation. The following self-report measures were
              administered during both school and vacation: the Pittsburgh
              Sleep Quality Index, Inventory of High-School Students Recent
              Life Experiences (stress), Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale, and the Brief
              COPE (coping). RESULTS: Path analyses showed that during both
              school and vacation, higher cognitive PSA mediated the
              relationship between higher stress and longer self-report SOL (p
              < 0.01). During vacation, higher PSA also mediated the
              relationship between higher stress and longer actigraphy SOL (p <
              0.05). During vacation (but not school), problem-focused coping
              moderated the mediating effects of PSA (p < 0.05), such that more
              frequent use of coping was associated with weaker association
              between stress and cognitive PSA, and shorter actigraphy and
              self-report SOL. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive PSA and coping may be two
              modifiable factors influencing how stress affects adolescents'
              sleep onset. Interventions that reduce cognitive arousal at
              bedtime may therefore shorten adolescents' sleep onset during
              both school and vacation. Further, the use of problem-focused
              coping strategies might be protective against the effects of
              stress on sleep onset, especially during vacation periods.
              STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This paper expands the understanding
              of the stress-sleep association in adolescents by examining the
              mediating role of cognitive pre-sleep arousal and the moderating
              effects of coping. By examining these associations during both
              school and vacation periods, findings are likely to be applicable
              to both restricted and relatively unconstrained sleep conditions.
              Practically, our findings suggest that interventions directed
              towards the reduction of cognitive pre-sleep arousal may improve
              adolescents' sleep onset latency. Additionally, fostering healthy
              coping, especially problem-focused coping strategies such as
              problem solving, may mitigate the effects of stress on
              adolescents' sleep.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Poor sleep, including symptoms of insomnia are common
              during pregnancy and postpartum periods. Poor sleep during the
              perinatal period is linked to impaired daytime functioning, mood
              disturbance, and risk for chronic insomnia. Cognitive behavioural
              therapy (CBT) is consistently shown to be efficacious in treating
              insomnia, but it is largely inaccessible to new mothers, and
              surprisingly, not part of current perinatal care. This study aims
              to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a scalable CBT-based
              intervention for better sleep quality. METHODS: In this
              single-blind randomised controlled trial, eligible nulliparous
              women are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention
              (CBT) or active control (healthy diet) condition. The
              interventions are provided from the third trimester till 6 months
              postpartum. The primary outcome is maternal sleep quality and
              secondary outcomes are maternal sleep-related impairment, mood,
              health-related quality of life, relationship satisfaction, and
              mother-infant-relationship, all assessed using validated
              instruments at 30- (baseline) and 35 weeks gestation (pregnancy
              endpoint), and 1.5, 3, and 6 months (postpartum endpoint) after
              childbirth, with follow-up assessments conducted at 1-year and
              2-year postpartum. DISCUSSION: This study has the potential to
              address the need for an evidence-based, non-pharmacological sleep
              intervention tailored for the pregnancy and postpartum periods.
              The intervention is designed to maximise reach and minimise cost,
              with the potential to scale up and incorporate in routine
              perinatal care. With outcomes measured at 8 time points, from the
              third trimester of pregnancy to 2-year postpartum, this study has
              the potential to examine both short- and long-term impact on
              maternal sleep and wellbeing. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Women with breast cancer experience a significantly
              higher prevalence of sleep disturbance and insomnia than the
              general population. The experience of persistent sleep
              disturbance places these women at a higher risk of psychological
              and physical morbidity and a reduced quality of life. Treatment
              for sleep in this population is not part of routine care and is
              often managed inadequately. This randomised controlled trial will
              examine the combined effects of cognitive behavioural therapy
              (CBT) and bright light therapy (BLT) on the symptoms of insomnia,
              fatigue and mental health. METHOD/DESIGN: Women diagnosed with
              breast cancer who receive intravenous chemotherapy treatment at a
              quaternary referral metropolitan cancer centre in Melbourne,
              Australia, will be recruited. Recruitment will occur after
              diagnosis and prior to completion of chemotherapy. Eligible women
              will be randomised to the combined CBT and BLT intervention
              (CBT+) or relaxation audio-enhanced treatment as usual (TAU+).
              The CBT+ group will receive one face-to-face session on sleep
              strategies, one subsequent telephone call, and seven email
              packages containing CBT-based information and strategies. CBT+
              participants will also wear Luminette\textregistered{} light
              glasses for 20 min each morning for the 6-week duration of the
              intervention. Women in TAU+ will receive two relaxation audio
              tracks via email. Outcomes will be measured at multiple points
              throughout the 6 weeks. Primary outcomes will be symptoms of
              insomnia and sleep efficiency, measured using the Insomnia
              Severity Index and a self-reported sleep diary. Secondary
              outcomes include objective measures of sleep assessed using the
              ActiGraph wGT3X-BT, and sleep-related complaints, fatigue and
              mental health, all assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes
              Measurement Information System (PROMIS). Data will also be
              collected on potential treatment moderators and mechanisms and
              adherence to treatment. There will be 3-month follow-up
              measurements of insomnia symptoms, fatigue, sleep-related
              impairment, sleep disturbance, depression and anxiety.
              DISCUSSION: This is the first randomised controlled trial to
              combine CBT and BLT for the treatment of sleep disturbance in
              women with breast cancer. This novel design addresses the
              multiple causal factors for sleep complaints in this population.
              Results from this trial will advance knowledge in this field and
              may have important clinical implications for how best to treat
              sleep disturbance and insomnia in this population. If effective,

              have been associated with a range of negative maternal and child
              outcomes. Despite this, interventions to improve maternal

              paper outlines the development, design, and implementation of the
              trial.Methods: Participants are an Australian community-sample of
              90 first-time mothers who are 4--12 months postpartum with
              self-reported symptoms of insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index
              scores $\geq$ 8). Exclusion criteria include current severe
              sleep/psychiatric disorders, unsettled infant sleep behaviour,
              sleep-affecting medication use, and photosensitivity. Eligible
              women are randomised into a CBT (strategies targeting sleep,
              worries, fatigue, and relaxation), LDT, or a treatment-as-usual
              control condition. Interventions are therapist-assisted and
              personalised through two telephone calls and include a series of
              automated intervention emails delivered over 6 weeks. Primary and
              secondary outcomes are assessed at four time points: baseline,
              intervention mid-point, post-intervention, and 1-month
              post-intervention.Discussion: If found effective, these
              interventions could represent efficacious, safe, and inexpensive
              treatments for improving postpartum insomnia and mitigate its
              negative impact on maternal well-being. Interventions tested are

  abstract = "STUDY OBJECTIVES: To describe trajectories of perceived daily
              sleep need and sleep debt, and examine if cumulative perceived
              sleep debt predicts next-day affect. METHODS: Daily sleep and
              affect were measured over 2 school weeks and 2 vacation weeks
              (N=205, 54.1\% females, M$\pm$SDage = 16.9$\pm$0.87 years). Each
              day, participants wore actigraphs and self-reported the amount of
              sleep needed to function well the next day (i.e., perceived sleep
              need), sleep duration, and high- and low-arousal positive and
              negative affect (PA, NA). Cumulative perceived sleep debt was
              calculated as the weighted average of the difference between
              perceived sleep need and sleep duration over the past 3 days.
              Cross-lagged, multilevel models were used to test cumulative
              sleep debt as a predictor of next-day affect. Lagged affect, day
              of the week, study day, and sociodemographics were controlled.
              RESULTS: Perceived sleep need was lower early in the school week,
              before increasing in the second half of the week. Adolescents
              accumulated perceived sleep debt across school days and reduced
              it during weekends. On weekends and vacations, adolescents
              self-reported meeting their sleep need, sleeping the amount, or
              more than the amount of sleep they perceived as needing. Higher
              cumulative actigraphy sleep debt predicted higher next-day high
              arousal NA; higher cumulative diary sleep debt predicted higher
              NA (regardless of arousal), and lower low arousal PA the
              following day. CONCLUSION: Adolescents experienced sustained,
              cumulative perceived sleep debt across school days. Weekends and
              vacations appeared to be opportunities for reducing sleep debt.
              Trajectories of sleep debt during vacation suggested recovery
              from school-related sleep restriction. Cumulative sleep debt was
              related to affect on a daily basis, highlighting the value of
              this measure for future research and interventions.",

               disturbances in women during the week after delivery. DESIGN:
               Sleep and mood were measured during the third trimester (Time-1)
               and one week postpartum (Time-2) in a 2-stage longitudinal
               design. SETTING: Participants were recruited from an antenatal
               clinic in a regional Melbourne hospital. PARTICIPANTS:
               Forty-four healthy women at low risk for postpartum depression.
               INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Objective sleep
               was measured by actigraphy and subjective sleep by the
               Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; mood was assessed by the
               Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, the Hospital Anxiety Depression
               Scale, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Sleep and
               mood questionnaires were administered at Time-1 and Time-2.
               Wrist actigraphy was collected for one week at both times. After
               delivery, both objective and subjective nighttime sleep
               significantly worsened with decreased total sleep time and sleep
               efficiency, while daytime napping behavior significantly
               increased. On average, mood improved across all scales after
               delivery, although 45.95\% of the sample experienced
               deterioration of mood. Regression analyses showed little
               relationship between Time-1 and Time-2 objective nighttime
               sleep, and postpartum mood. Variables that related to both

               subjective nighttime sleep, sleep-related daytime dysfunction,
               and daytime napping behavior, were significant predictors of
               postpartum mood. CONCLUSIONS: The perception of poor sleep, and
               the conscious awareness of its impact during wake-time, might
               share a stronger relationship with the occurrence of immediate
               postpartum mood disturbances than actual sleep quality and

  abstract  = "Abstract The current literature suggests that nighttime sleep is
               compromised during late pregnancy and early postpartum periods,
               but little is known about the 24-hour sleep pattern during this
               time. This study aims to first, explore the day-to-day changes
               in the quantity and quality of objectively measured sleep during
               the week immediately before and after the day of delivery, and
               second, to provide descriptive data on timing of naps during
               late pregnancy and the first week postpartum. Twenty-four
               healthy women completed one week of actigraphy assessment during
               the third trimester, and six days before and after delivery.
               Demographic and obstetric information was collected via
               questionnaires. Nighttime sleep was significantly disrupted and
               shortened immediately after giving birth, while napping behavior
               significantly increased. Total sleep time across 24?hours,
               however, remained stable due to increased napping behaviors.
               Across the first postpartum week, nighttime sleep improved
               linearly, with its quantity, but not quality, comparable to that
               of the third trimester on the sixth postpartum day. Napping
               behavior decreased linearly during the first postpartum week,
               although participants continued to take more naps on the sixth
               postpartum day than during the third trimester. During antenatal
               periods, naps were most likely to occur during early afternoon,
               while during the first postpartum week, naps were evenly
               distributed across late morning to early evening. These findings
               suggest that sleep is redistributed across 24-hour periods
               during immediate postpartum, and this redistribution raises
               questions on the restorative value of sleep women obtain after
               giving birth.",

              the impact of floods on the mental and physical health of older
              adults and explored risk and protective factors. METHOD: Two
              hundred and seventy four older adults (age $\geq$60) completed
              surveys before and after a flood event. Both the surveys included
              measures of anxiety, depression, self-reported health, and
              satisfaction with life; the post-flood survey also included
              questionnaires on flood experience, symptoms of post-traumatic
              stress disorder (PTSD), stoicism, and psychological coping with
              floods. RESULTS: Compared to those not personally affected
              (78.8\%), personally affected individuals (21.2\%) reported
              significantly higher PTSD symptoms, with about one in six
              reporting PTSD symptoms that might require clinical attention.
              Personally affected individuals also reported a greater increase
              in anxiety post-flood, but changes in their depressive symptoms
              and self-reported health were not significantly different from
              those not personally affected. Greater flood exposure and the
              lack of social support were the risk factors for poorer mental
              and physical health. Higher stoicism was associated with higher
              post-flood depression and poorer self-reported mental health. The
              use of maladaptive coping, such as venting and distraction, was
              associated with greater deterioration in mental health after
              floods, whilst emotion-focused coping such as acceptance,
              positive reframing, and humour, was protective against such
              deterioration. CONCLUSION: Floods had adverse psychological
              impacts on some older adults who were personally affected.
              Despite the evidence of resilience, a small proportion of older
              adults experienced significant difficulties after the floods. The
              findings in this study help understand older adults'
              psychological responses to disasters and have practical
              implications for service planning and delivery.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Attitudes are known to exert a powerful influence on
               a range of behaviors. The objective of this study was to

               to satisfaction with life and physical and mental health
               measured in a sample of community-dwelling older adults.
               METHODS: Adults who were part of a larger study of health and
               well-being in rural and regional Australia aged $\geq$60 years
               (N = 421) completed a cross-sectional postal survey comprising
               the Attitudes to Aging Questionnaire, the 12-Item Short Form
               Health Survey (SF-12), the Satisfaction with Life Scale, the
               Geriatric Anxiety Inventory, and the Center for Epidemiological
               Studies Depression Scale. RESULTS: Overall, attitudes to aging
               were positive in this sample. More positive attitudes to aging
               were associated with higher levels of satisfaction with life,
               better self-report physical and mental health on the SF-12, and
               lower levels of anxiety and depression, after controlling for
               confounding variables. Better financial status and being
               employed were both associated with more positive attitudes to
               aging and better self-reported physical health. Relationship
               status was also significantly associated with mental health and
               satisfaction with life, but not physical health. CONCLUSION: The
               promotion of successful aging is increasingly becoming important
               in aging societies. Having positive attitudes to aging may
               contribute to healthier mental and physical outcomes in older
               adults. Overcoming negative stereotypes of aging through change
               at the societal and individual level may help to promote more
               successful aging.",

              contribute to the formation of attitudes toward one's own aging.
              The current study aimed to examine personality as defined by the
              Five-Factor model of personality as an antecedent of attitudes,
              while taking into account demographic and health factors known to
              be relevant to such attitudes. DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants
              aged 60 years or older (N = 421) were part of a longitudinal
              study of health and well-being in Australia, and completed a
              postal survey comprising measures of personality, the Attitudes
              to Ageing Questionnaire, the SF-12 health survey, and the
              Satisfaction with Life Scale. RESULTS: Higher levels of
              neuroticism were associated with less positive attitudes toward
              old age as a time of psychological growth, and higher
              extraversion and agreeableness were significant predictors of
              less negative attitudes toward psychosocial loss. Baseline
              measures of self-reported mental and physical health, as well as
              change in those scores, also made significant contributions to
              attitudes toward aging. IMPLICATIONS: Personality was a
              significant antecedent of attitudes towards aging, as were mental
              and physical health. The data highlight the role of potentially
              modifiable factors, such as mental and physical health. If these
              factors act as resources that shape an individual's attitudes
              during the aging process, then one potential foundation for
              holding positive attitudes to aging is to maintain physical and
              mental health. This requires interventions and policies that are
              effective in encouraging health-promoting behaviors.",

              younger adults, but there is little understanding about the
              drinking motivations of older adults. Although emerging evidence
              shows the importance of studying older adults' own reasoning for
              their alcohol consumption, measures that have been used to assess
              such reasons lack psychometric assessment. This study aims to

              Using confirmatory factor analysis, the results supported a

              motivations for drinking were the most frequently endorsed,

              frequent drinking for each of the three motives. Social motives
              were consistently related to drinking behaviors and coping had a
              direct relationship to drinking problems. Overall, the study

               variety of discharge patterns, including units that have higher
               discharge rates during inspiration (inspiratory phasic and
               inspiratory tonic), or expiration (expiratory phasic and
               expiratory tonic), or do not modify their rate with respiration
               (tonic). Previous studies have shown that an increase in GG
               muscle activity is a consequence of increased activity in
               inspiratory units. However, there are differences between
               studies as to whether this increase is primarily due to
               recruitment of new motor units (motor unit recruitment) or to
               increased discharge rate of already active units (rate coding).
               Sleep-wake state studies in humans have suggested the former,
               while hypercapnia experiments in rats have suggested the latter.
               In this study, we investigated the effect of hypercapnia on GG
               motor unit activity in humans during wakefulness. SETTING: sleep
               research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: sixteen healthy men.
               MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: each participant was administered at
               least 6 trials with P(et)CO(2) being elevated 8.4 (SD = 1.96) mm
               Hg over 2 min following a 30-s baseline. Subjects were
               instrumented for GG EMG and respiratory measurements with 4 fine
               wire electrodes inserted subcutaneously into the muscle. One
               hundred forty-one motor units were identified during the
               baseline: 47\% were inspiratory modulated, 29\% expiratory
               modulated, and 24\% showed no respiratory related modulation.
               Sixty-two new units were recruited during hypercapnia. The

               respiratory pattern generator (RPG) output. However, unlike GG,
               TP shows minimal respiratory modulation and presumably has few
               inspiratory modulated motor units and minimal input from the
               RPG. Thus, we investigated the mechanism by which TP reduces
               activity at sleep onset. DESIGN: The activity of TP motor units
               were studied during relaxed wakefulness and over the transition
               from wakefulness to sleep. SETTING: Sleep laboratory.
               PARTICIPANTS: Nine young (21.4 $\pm$ 3.4 years) males were
               studied on a total of 11 nights. INTERVENTION: Sleep onset.
               MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Two TP EMGs (thin, hooked wire
               electrodes), and sleep and respiratory measures were recorded.
               One hundred twenty-one sleep onsets were identified (13.4 $\pm$
               7.2/subject), resulting in 128 motor units (14.3 $\pm$
               13.0/subject); 29\% of units were tonic, 43\% inspiratory
               modulated (inspiratory phasic 18\%, inspiratory tonic 25\%), and
               28\% expiratory modulated (expiratory phasic 21\%, expiratory
               tonic 7\%). There was a reduction in both expiratory and
               inspiratory modulated units, but not tonic units, at sleep
               onset. Reduced TP activity was almost entirely due to
               de-recruitment. CONCLUSIONS: TP showed a similar distribution of
               motor units as other airway muscles. However, a greater
               proportion of expiratory modulated motor units were active in TP
               and these expiratory units, along with inspiratory units, tended
               to become silent over sleep onset. The data suggest that both
               expiratory and inspiratory drive components from the RPG are
               reduced at sleep onset in TP.",
