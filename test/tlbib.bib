               protein unfolding temperature. Our results highlight that 'soft'

              (AATs) to increase amino acid uptake in response to
              nutrient-insufficiency. The upregulation of AATs is therefore
              critical for tumor development and progression. This study
              identifies the upregulated AATs under amino acid deprived

              importance of these AATs in evaluating the prognosis of patients
              with cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study,
              the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets (GSE62673, GSE26370,
              GSE125782 and GSE150874) were downloaded from the NCBI website and
              utilized for integrated differential expression and pathway
              analysis v0.96, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and REACTOME
              analyses to identify the AATs upregulated in response to amino
              acid deprivation. In addition, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
              datasets with prognostic information were assessed and employed to
              evaluate the association of identified AATs with patients'
              prognoses using SurvExpress analysis. RESULTS: Using analysis of
              NCBI GEO data, this study shows that amino acid deprivation leads
              to the upregulation of six AAT genes; SLC3A2, SLC7A5, SLC7A1,
              SLC1A4, SLC7A11 and SLC1A5. GSEA and REACTOME analyses identified
              altered signaling in cells exposed to amino acid deprivation, such
              as pathways related to stress responses, the cell cycle and
              apoptosis. In addition, Principal Component Analysis showed these
              six AAT genes to be well divided into two distinct clusters in
              relation to TCGA tumor tissues versus normal counterparts.
              Finally, Log-Rank analysis confirmed the upregulation of this
              panel of six AAT genes is correlated with poor prognosis in
              patients with colorectal, esophageal, kidney and lung cancers.
              CONCLUSION: The upregulation of a panel of six AATs is common in
              several human cancers and may provide a valuable diagnostic tool

              frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancers. However,
              phosphorylation sites of PIK3CA/p110α and their underlying
              mechanism in tumorigenesis are largely unknown. METHODS: Tyrosine

              Mass-Spectrum. Crispr/CAS9 strategy is applied to generate Y317F

              Phospho-proteomics analysis and Western blots are used to

              phosphorylation. In vitro kinase assay is applied to identify the
              kinase of PIK3CA/p110α tyrosine phosphorylation. RESULTS: Tyrosine
              phosphorylation of PIK3CA/p110α is stimulated by growth factors
              such as EGF, HGF and PDGF. Two tyrosine residues, Y317 and Y508,
              are identified on PIK3CA/p110α. Either Y317 or Y508
              phosphorylation is essential for tumorigenesis of CRC. Mutation at
              Y317 of p110α reduces the proliferation, migration, and invasion
              of cancer cells through Src-MLC2 pathway, while mutation at Y508
              of p110α impairs AKT signaling. Moreover, Src interacts with and
              phosphorylates p110α. CONCLUSIONS: PIK3CA/p110α phosphorylation at
              Y317 and Y508 play important role in tumorigenesis of colorectal

              METHODS: Transcriptomics data (GSE184836) from DKD mice
              (C57BLKS/J) were retrieved from the GEO database and intersected
              with ferroptosis-related genes from FerrDb. Then, differentially

              tubules were screened. Gene ontology analysis and protein-protein
              interaction network construction were used to identify key genes.
              Western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain

               GR binding and transcriptome data from Dexamethasone (Dex)

               Transcriptome analysis of Dex treated cardiomyocytes with or

              pathogen causing important avian diseases in poultry. As an
              important subtype of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli, APEC has
              zoonotic potential and is considered a foodborne pathogen. APEC
              extracellular vesicles (EVs) may play vital roles in the
              interaction of the pathogen with its host cells. However, the
              precise roles played by APEC EVs are still not completely clear,
              especially in immune cells. RESULTS: In this study, we
              investigated the relationships between APEC EVs and immune cells.
              The production and characteristics of the EVs of APEC isolate
              CT265 were identified. Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) triggered the
              cellular immune responses when it interacted with APEC EVs. APEC
              EVs induced a significant release of proinflammatory cytokines in
              THP-1 macrophages. APEC EVs induced the macrophage inflammatory
              response via the TLR4/MYD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, which
              participated in the activation of the APEC-EV-induced NLRP3
              inflammasome. However, the loss of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from
              APEC EVs reduced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome mediated
              by TLR4/MYD88/NF-κB signaling. Because APEC EVs activated the
              macrophage inflammatory response and cytokines release, we
              speculated that the interaction between APEC EVs and macrophages
              activated and promoted neutrophil migration during APEC
              extraintestinal infection. This study is the first to report that
              APEC EVs induce the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps
              (NETs) and chicken heterophil extracellular traps. Treatment with
              APEC EVs induced SAPK/JNK activation in neutrophils. The
              inhibition of TLR4 signaling suppressed APEC-EV-induced NET
              formation. However, although APEC EVs activated the immune
              response of macrophages and initiated NET formation, they also
              damaged macrophages, causing their apoptosis. The loss of LPS from
              APEC EVs did not prevent this process. CONCLUSION: APEC-derived
              EVs induced inflammatory responses in macrophages and NETs in
              neutrophils, and that TLR4 was involved in the APEC-EV-activated
              inflammatory response. These findings provided a basis for the
              further study of APEC pathogenesis.",

              production via enzymolysis is now generally with sodium alginate
              as the raw material, which is chemically extracted from brown
              algae. In contrast, AOs production by direct degradation of brown
              algae is more advantageous on account of its cost reduction and is
              more eco-friendly. However, there have been only a few attempts
              reported in AOs production from direct degradation of brown algae.
              RESULTS: In this study, an efficient Laminaria
              japonica-decomposing strain Pseudoalteromonas agarivorans A3 was
              screened. Based on the secretome and mass spectrum analyses,
              strain A3 showed the potential as a cell factory for AOs
              production by secreting alginate lyases to directly degrade L.
              japonica. By using the L. japonica roots, which are normally
              discarded in the food industry, as the raw material for both
              fermentation and enzymatic hydrolysis, AOs were produced by the
              fermentation broth supernatant of strain A3 after optimization of
              the alginate lyase production and hydrolysis parameters. The
              generated AOs mainly ranged from dimers to tetramers, among which
              trimers and tetramers were predominant. The degradation efficiency
              of the roots reached 54.58\%, the AOs production was 33.11\%, and
              the AOs purity was 85.03\%. CONCLUSION: An efficient,

  abstract  = "Migrating epithelial cells globally align their migration
               machinery to achieve tissue-level movement. Biochemical signaling
               across leading-trailing cell-cell interfaces can promote this
               alignment by partitioning migratory behaviors like protrusion and
               retraction to opposite sides of the interface. However, how
               signaling proteins become organized at interfaces to accomplish
               this is poorly understood. The follicular epithelial cells of
               Drosophila melanogaster have two signaling modules at their
               leading-trailing interfaces - one composed of the atypical
               cadherin Fat2 (also known as Kugelei) and the receptor tyrosine
               phosphatase Lar, and one composed of Semaphorin5c and its
               receptor Plexin A. Here, we show that these modules form one
               interface signaling system with Fat2 at its core. Trailing
               edge-enriched Fat2 concentrates both Lar and Semaphorin5c at
               leading edges of cells, but Lar and Semaphorin5c play little role
               in the localization of Fat2. Fat2 is also more stable at
               interfaces than Lar or Semaphorin5c. Once localized, Lar and
               Semaphorin5c act in parallel to promote collective migration. We
               propose that Fat2 serves as the organizer of this interface
               signaling system by coupling and polarizing the distributions of
               multiple effectors that work together to align the migration
               machinery of neighboring cells.",

              in clinical patients with CRC. It has been shown that exosomes
              promote phenotypic changes in macrophages and tumor metastasis in
              the CRC tumor microenvironment. In this study, we used miRNA-seq
              technology to screen out the highly expressed miR-372-5p among the
              miRNAs differentially expressed in plasma exosomes of clinical CRC
              patients. It was found that miR-372-5p highly expressed in HCT116
              exosomes could be phagocytosed by macrophages and promote their
              polarization into M2 macrophages by regulating the PTEN/AKT
              pathway. Meanwhile, co-culture of CRC cells with conditioned
              medium (CM) of macrophages enhanced the EMT, stemness and
              metastasis of CRC cells. Mechanistically, CRC cells
              exosome-derived miR-372-5p induced polarized M2 macrophages to

              breast cancer-susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) protein in the
              β-Glucan (βG) molecule mediated regulation of lipopolysaccharide
              (LPS)-induced liver genotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this
              experimental study, totally, 32 male Swiss Albino mice were
              randomly divided into 4 equal groups: control (C),
              LPS-administered (LPS), βG-administered (βG) and
              βG-pre-administered/LPS-administered (βG+LPS). The βG was injected
              at the dose of 150 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 3 days.
              A single dose of 4 mg/ kg (i.p.) LPS was administered 24 hours
              after the last βG injection. BRCA1 expression was determined by
              western blot analysis and confirmed by quantitative
              immunofluorescence. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA),
              nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) and 8-OHdG
              protein levels were also determined by the immunofluorescence
              analysis. The alkaline comet assay was performed. superoxide
              dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and membrane lipid peroxidation
              were biochemically measured, and light microscopic histology was
              evaluated. RESULTS: The BRCA1 expression level was significantly
              decreased in the LPS group. However, in the βG+LPS group,
              expression of BRCA1 protein was over 2 folds higher than the
              control. After the LPS induction, the DNA strand breaks, oxidative
              DNA lesions and abnormal proliferation of the liver cells were
              almost entirely suppressed in βG preadministrated animals,
              indicating the BRCA1 mediated ubiquitination of PCNA and
              activation of the DNA damage repair pathways. Activation of Nrf2
              in the βG+LPS group resulted in an increase in the levels of Nrf2
              pathway dependent antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT, prevented the
              peroxidation of membrane lipids and maintained the histological
              architecture of the liver. CONCLUSION: The results manifested that
              the βG is a strong inducer of the BRCA1 protein expression in the
              LPSinduced hepatic stress and the protein constitutes the key
              component of a βG mediated liver protection against an LPS-induced
              genotoxic and pathological damage.",

               of maintaining and sustaining cognitive performance. We have
               reported that chewing may improve or recover the process of
               working memory; however, the mechanisms underlying these
               phenomena are still to be elucidated. We investigated the effect

               cognitive performance. Seventeen healthy adults (20-34 years old)
               were studied during attention task with blood oxygenation
               level-dependent functional (fMRI) at 3.0 T MRI. The attentional
               network test (ANT) within a single task fMRI containing two cue
               conditions (no cue and center cue) and two target conditions
               (congruent and incongruent) was conducted to examine the
               efficiency of alerting and executive control. Participants were
               instructed to press a button with the right or left thumb
               according to the direction of a centrally presented arrow. Each
               participant underwent two back-to-back ANT sessions with or
               without chewing gum, odorless and tasteless to remove any effect
               other than chewing. Behavioral results showed that mean reaction
               time was significantly decreased during chewing condition,
               regardless of speed-accuracy trade-off, although there were no
               significant changes in behavioral effects (both alerting and
               conflict effects). On the other hand, fMRI analysis revealed
               higher activations in the anterior cingulate cortex and left
               frontal gyrus for the executive network and motor-related regions
               for both attentional networks during chewing condition. These
               results suggested that chewing induced an increase in the arousal
               level and alertness in addition to an effect on motor control
               and, as a consequence, these effects could lead to improvements
               in cognitive performance.",
