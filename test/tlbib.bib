  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of ferroptosis in diabetic kidney
              tubules has been documented, yet the underlying mechanism remains
              elusive. The aim of this study was to ascertain the pivotal gene
              linked to ferroptosis and establish a novel target for the
              prevention and management of diabetic kidney disease (DKD).
              METHODS: Transcriptomics data (GSE184836) from DKD mice
              (C57BLKS/J) were retrieved from the GEO database and intersected
              with ferroptosis-related genes from FerrDb. Then, differentially
              expressed genes associated with ferroptosis in the glomeruli and
              tubules were screened. Gene ontology analysis and protein-protein
              interaction network construction were used to identify key genes.
              Western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain
              reaction were employed to validate the expression in the same
              model. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein
              1 (ARNTL) expression in patients and mice with DKD was assessed
              using immunohistochemistry staining. ARNTL knockdown in C57BLKS/J
              mice was established and plasma malonaldehyde, superoxide
              dismutase, and renal pathology were analyzed. The efficacy of
              ARNTL knockdown was evaluated using proteomics analysis.
              Mitochondrial morphology was observed using transmission electron
              microscopy. RESULTS: ARNTL was screened by bioinformatics analysis
              and its overexpression verified in patients and mice with DKD.
              ARNTL knockdown reduced oxidative stress in plasma. Kidney
              proteomics revealed that ferroptosis was inhibited. The reduction
              of the classic alteration in mitochondrial morphology associated
              with ferroptosis was also observed. Gene set enrichment analysis
              demonstrated that the downregulation of the TGF$\beta$ pathway
              coincided with a decrease in collagen protein and TGF$\beta$1
              levels. CONCLUSIONS: The ferroptosis-associated gene ARNTL is a
              potential target for treating DKD.",

              function remain poorly identified. Here, we explored the roles of
              Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) in prostate stem cells, prostate
              development and regeneration. Using YAPfl/fl, CD133-CreER mice, we
              found that stem cell-specific YAP-deficient mice had compromised
              branching morphogenesis and epithelial differentiation, resulting
              in damaged prostate development. YAP inhibition also significantly
              affected the regeneration process of mice prostate, leading to
              impaired regenerated prostate. Furthermore, YAP ablation in
              prostate stem cells significantly reduced its self-renewal
              activity in vitro, and attenuated prostate regeneration of
              prostate grafts in vivo. Further analysis revealed a decrease in
              Notch and Hedgehog pathways expression in YAP inhibition cells,
              and treatment with exogenous Shh partially restored the
              self-renewal ability of prostate sphere cells. Taken together, our
              results revealed the roles of YAP in prostate stem cell function

              the Notch and Hedgehog signaling pathways.",

               machinery to achieve tissue-level movement. Biochemical signaling
               across leading-trailing cell-cell interfaces can promote this
               alignment by partitioning migratory behaviors like protrusion and
               retraction to opposite sides of the interface. However, how
               signaling proteins become organized at interfaces to accomplish
               this is poorly understood. The follicular epithelial cells of
               Drosophila melanogaster have two signaling modules at their
               leading-trailing interfaces - one composed of the atypical
               cadherin Fat2 (also known as Kugelei) and the receptor tyrosine
               phosphatase Lar, and one composed of Semaphorin5c and its
               receptor Plexin A. Here, we show that these modules form one
               interface signaling system with Fat2 at its core. Trailing
               edge-enriched Fat2 concentrates both Lar and Semaphorin5c at
               leading edges of cells, but Lar and Semaphorin5c play little role
               in the localization of Fat2. Fat2 is also more stable at
               interfaces than Lar or Semaphorin5c. Once localized, Lar and
               Semaphorin5c act in parallel to promote collective migration. We
               propose that Fat2 serves as the organizer of this interface
               signaling system by coupling and polarizing the distributions of
               multiple effectors that work together to align the migration
               machinery of neighboring cells.",
