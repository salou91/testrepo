               extend the reach of gravitational-wave detectors are desired. In
               addition to the stellar-mass black hole and neutron star mergers
               already detected, many more are below the surface of the noise,
               available for detection if the noise is reduced enough. Our
               method (DeepClean) applies machine-learning algorithms to
               gravitational-wave detector data and data from on-site sensors
               monitoring the instrument to reduce the noise in the time series
               due to instrumental artifacts and environmental contamination.
               This framework is generic enough to subtract linear, nonlinear,
               and nonstationary coupling mechanisms. It may also provide
               handles in learning about the mechanisms which are not currently
               understood to be limiting detector sensitivities. The robustness
               of the noise-reduction technique in its ability to efficiently
               remove noise with no unintended effects on gravitational-wave
               signals is also addressed through software signal injection and
               parameter estimation of the recovered signal. It is shown that
               the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the injected signal is
               enhanced by ≈21.6\% and the recovered parameters are consistent
               with the injected set. We present the performance of this
               algorithm on linear and nonlinear noise sources and discuss its
               impact on astrophysical searches by gravitational-wave detectors.",

              three cataclysmic variables (CVs) namely LS Cam, V902 Mon, and
              SWIFT J0746.3-1608, using the long-baseline, high-cadence optical
              photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite
              (TESS). Our analysis of LS Cam observations hints the presence of
              a superorbital period of $\sim$ 4.025$\pm$0.007 d along with
              negative and positive superhump periods of $\sim$ 3.30 h and 3.70
              h, respectively. These results can be explained as an interaction
              of nodal and apsidal precession of the accretion disc with orbital
              motion. For the other two sources, V902 Mon and SWIFT
              J0746.3-1608, we have found evidence of a beat period of
              2387.0$\pm$0.6 s and 2409.5$\pm$0.7 s, respectively, which were
              not found in earlier studies. Our results presented in this study
              indicate the change in the accretion mode during the entire
              observing period for both sources. For V902 Mon, an apparent
              orbital period derivative of (6.09 $\pm$ 0.60) $\times 10^{-10}$
              was also found. Moreover, the second harmonic of orbital frequency
              dominates the power spectrum of SWIFT J0746.3-1608, suggestive of
              ellipsoidal modulation of the secondary star. Present analyses
              suggest that LS Cam could be a superhumping CV whereas V902 Mon
              and SWIFT J0746.3-1608 are likely to be variable disc-overflow

              These densities represent a large diversity of interior

              have shown that the densities of planets that orbit a common star

              the system HIP 41378 (also known as K2-93), which contains a

              results from head-on to grazing collisions. The results of the
              simulations fall into two broad categories: 1) one main
              post-collision remnant containing material from target and
              projectile; 2) two main post-collision remnants resulting from
              `erosive hit-and-run' collisions. All collisions removed at least
              some of the target atmosphere, in contrast to the idealised
              hit-and-run definition in which the target mass is unchanged. We
              find that the boundary between `hit-and-run' collisions and
              collisions that result in the projectile and target
              accreting/merging to be strongly correlated with the mutual escape
              velocity at the predicted point of closest approach. Our work
              shows that it is very unlikely for a single giant impact to remove
              all of the atmosphere. For all the atmosphere to be removed,
              head-on impacts require roughly the energy of catastrophic
              disruption (i.e. permanent ejection of half the total system mass)
              and result in significant erosion of the mantle. We show that
              higher impact angle collisions, which are more common, are less
              efficient at atmosphere removal than head-on collisions.
              Therefore, single collisions that remove all the atmosphere
              without substantially disrupting the planet are not expected
              during planet formation.",

               The Earth's chemical composition can be determined by combining
               observations from large neutrino detectors with seismic

  abstract = "The sensitivity of the Advanced LIGO detectors to gravitational
              waves can be affected by environmental disturbances external to
              the detectors themselves. Since the transition from the former
              initial LIGO phase, many improvements have been made to the
              equipment and techniques used to investigate these environmental
              effects. These methods have aided in tracking down and mitigating
              noise sources throughout the first three observing runs of the
              advanced detector era, keeping the ambient contribution of
              environmental noise below the background noise levels of the
              detectors. In this paper we describe the methods used and how they
              have led to the mitigation of noise sources, the role that
              environmental monitoring has played in the validation of
              gravitational wave events, and plans for future observing runs.",

               Higgs boson and measurement of some of its properties are

               CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions during the 2011 and
               2012 LHC running periods. The data samples correspond to
               integrated luminosities of 5.1(Equation Present) and
               19.7(Equation Present). A clear signal is observed in the
               diphoton channel at a mass close to 125(Equation Present)A with a
               local significance of (Equation Present), where a significance of
               (Equation Present) is expected for the standard model Higgs
               boson. The mass is measured to be (Equation Present), and the
               best-fit signal strength relative to the standard model
               prediction is (Equation Present). Additional measurements include
               the signal strength modifiers associated with different
               production mechanisms, and hypothesis tests between spin-0 and
               spin-2 models.",

  abstract  = "A search for dark matter and unparticle production at the LHC has
               been performed using events containing two charged leptons
               (electrons or muons), consistent with the decay of a Z boson, and
               large missing transverse momentum. This study is based on data
               collected with the CMS detector in 2015, corresponding to an
               integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb−1 of proton-proton collisions at
               the LHC, at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No excess over the
               standard model expectation is observed. Compared to previous
               searches in this topology, which exclusively relied on effective
               field theories, the results are interpreted in terms of a
               simplified model of dark matter production for both vector and
               axial vector couplings between a mediator and dark matter
               particles. The first study of this class of models using CMS data
               at s=13 TeV is presented. Additionally, effective field theories
               of dark matter and unparticle production are used to interpret
               the data.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",

  abstract  = "This paper presents new sets of parameters (“tunes”) for the
               underlying-event model of the HERWIG7 event generator. These
               parameters control the description of multiple-parton
               interactions (MPI) and colour reconnection in HERWIG7, and are
               obtained from a fit to minimum-bias data collected by the CMS
               experiment at s=0.9, 7, and 13Te. The tunes are based on the
               NNPDF 3.1 next-to-next-to-leading-order parton distribution
               function (PDF) set for the parton shower, and either a
               leading-order or next-to-next-to-leading-order PDF set for the
               simulation of MPI and the beam remnants. Predictions utilizing
               the tunes are produced for event shape observables in
               electron-positron collisions, and for minimum-bias, inclusive
               jet, top quark pair, and Z and W boson events in proton-proton
               collisions, and are compared with data. Each of the new tunes
               describes the data at a reasonable level, and the tunes using a
               leading-order PDF for the simulation of MPI provide the best
               description of the data.",
