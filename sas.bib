               biomass selective laser sintering (SLS) parts is limited and
               low-quality. This study aims to demonstrate the effects of the
               various processing parameters on the dimensional accuracy,
               bending strength, tensile strength, density and impact strength
               of the Prosopis chilensis/polyethersulfone (PES) composites
               (PCPCs) that were produced by SLS. The various processing
               parameters are laser power, scan speed, preheating temperature,
               scan spacing and layer thickness. In addition, the authors’
               studied the effects of PCP particle size on the mechanical
               properties of the PCPCs. Design/methodology/approach: The PCPC
               specimens were printed using an AFS SLS machine (additive
               manufacturing). The bending, tensile and impact strengths of the
               specimens were measured using a universal tensile tester. The
               dimensional accuracy of the bending specimens was determined by a
               Vernier caliper. The formability of the PCPC at various mixing
               ratios of the raw materials was earlier investigated by
               single-layer sintering experiments (Idriss et al., 2020b). The
               microstructure and particle distribution of the various PCPC
               specimens were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
               Findings: The mechanical strengths (bending, tensile and impact
               strengths and density) and the dimensional accuracy of the PCPC
               SLS parts were directly and inversely proportional, respectively,
               to the laser power and preheating temperature. Furthermore, the
               mechanical strengths and dimensional accuracy of the PCPC SLS
               parts were inversely and directly proportional, respectively, to
               the scanning speed, scan spacing and layer thickness. Practical
               implications: PCPC is an inexpensive, energy-efficient material
               that can address the drawbacks of the existing SLS parts. It is
               also eco-friendly because it lowers the pollution and CO2
               emissions that are associated with waste disposal and SLS,
               respectively. The optimization of the processing parameters of
               SLS in this study produced high-quality PCPC parts with high
               mechanical strengths and dimensional accuracy that could be used
               for the manufacture of the roof and wooden floors, construction
               components and furniture manufacturing. Originality/value: To the
               best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is among the first to
               elucidate the impact of the various SLS processing parameters on
               the mechanical properties and dimensional accuracy of the
               sintered parts. Furthermore, novel PCPC parts were produced in
               this study by SLS. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

               industrialization to boost production, reduce material
               consumption, and improve workmanship. The 3D-printed concrete
               technology (3DPCT), more broadly recognized as the design of a 3D
               object via a computer-aided design (CAD) model or a digital 3D
               model, has accelerated considerable progress in these areas in
               other industries. Although 3DPCT has advanced remarkably in
               recent years, producing an appropriate 3D printing material that
               improves performance while reducing material consumption, which
               is really important for CO2 reduction, is urgently needed. The
               present 3DPCT faces many obstacles, one of which is the limited
               range of printable concretes. To tackle this limitation,
               extensive studies on developing creative approaches for
               formulating alkali-activated materials (AAMs) for 3DPCT for
               modern building applications have been conducted. AAMs are
               maintainable substitutive binders to ordinary Portland cement.
               Therefore, the need to undertake a comprehensive literature
               review on the current status of AAM performance on 3D-printable
               concretes for building applications is substantial. This article
               comprehensively reviews the quality requirements, advantages,
               disadvantages, common techniques, delivery, and placement of
               3DCP. This literature also delivers indepth reviews on the
               behaviors and the properties of AAM-based concrete composites
               used in 3D-printed construction. Moreover, research trends are
               moving toward a wide-ranging understanding concerning the
               economic benefits and the environmental footprints of 3DCP for
               building applications with AAMs as suitable concrete materials
               for the emerging robust eco-friendly concrete composite for
               digital construction constructions nowadays. Given the merits of
               the study, several hotspot research topics for future
               investigations are also provided for facilitating the wide use of
               3DPCT in real applications to address rapidly the gap between

               the case of concrete, it encounters significant challenges in
               terms of material design, since high paste volumes and Portland
               cement contents are normally used due to process requirements. In
               this article, the application to layered extrusion of a recently
               developed low clinker cement containing 50\% Portland cement and
               50\% supplementary cementitious materials, such as limestone,
               burnt oil shale, and fly ash, is presented. It is found that an

               for 3D printing, while not compromising the early and long-term
               compressive strength. Such a low clinker mortar can be
               successfully retarded, processed, pumped, and extruded just after
               mixing it in line with the accelerator paste. This accelerated
               mortar formulation contains only 303 kg/m3 of Portland cement,

               architect four customized 3D PVDF PEHs, and the relationship
               between the designed structures and corresponding piezoelectric
               output performances are systematically studied by theoretical
               simulation. The results show that, with a decreased force-bearing
               area, the effective deformation of the PEHs along the vertical
               direction increases, resulting in an excellent piezoelectric
               output. Thus, the optimal 3D conus arrayed PEH shows the highest
               piezoelectric output voltage of 8.69 V and current of 90.8 nA,
               which is about 2.75 times higher than that of the cylinder
               arrayed one. Additionally, the conus arrayed PEH can fast charge
               a 1 μF capacitor to 2.5 V within 100 s. This work manifests 3D
               printing as a powerful tool to reconcile the simulation and
               architecting for 3D PEHs with enhanced output performance for
               futuristic self-powered systems. © 2021 American Chemical Society",

               concepts and design complex 3D structures from metals, ceramics,
               and composites. Moreover, as a well-known transition metal

               (2D) material with outstanding electrochemical, physical, and

               energy storage electrodes via intercalation of different H+, Li+,
               Na+, and K+ cations. In this review, we discuss the existing

               However, the relatively restricted range of 3D printable
               biocomposites decelerated its adoption in the biomedical sector
               as a conventional manufacturing technique. In this method, the
               introduction of biofillers with unique properties to produce high
               performance composites as printing feedstocks are increasingly
               recommended. The interest in using eco-friendly fillers from
               waste as reinforcing agents for producing lightweight and
               low-cost poly(lactic acid) (PLA) composites is recently
               increased. In this work, a series of PLA biocomposites filled
               with calcined seashell (CSh) particles have been prepared by melt
               mixing technique using a twin-screw extruder, and characterized
               by different morphological, thermal, and mechanical methods. The
               visco-elastic parameters have been determined for these
               biocomposites to optimize their processing conditions. The
               morphological analysis revealed a homogenous dispersion of CSh
               fillers within the biopolymeric matrix, which was responsible for
               the enhancement of the various mechanical properties. Where, by
               adding 10 wt\% of treated CSh, the tensile modulus and strength
               were significantly increased from 183.8 ± 4.7 MPa and 29.81 ± 1.8
               MPa to 241.9 ± 63 MPa and 49.06 ± 8.87 MPa, respectively,
               compared to the virgin PLA. In addition, respected to PLA matrix,
               the compressive moduli of the printed specimens of PLA/5CSh and
               PLA/10CSh biocomposite filaments exhibited improvements of 5\%
               and 14\%, respectively. Moreover, the thermal analysis showed a
               marked improvement in the thermal stability of the elaborated
               biocomposites, where the degradation temperature (Td50) have been
               upgraded by 4°C for the biocomposite containing 10 wt\% of CSh
               bio-filler. These outstanding properties of PLA/CSh composites

               (CV). An office inkjet-printer and Gr nano-ink stabilized with

               demonstrates the proof-of-concept of the set-on-demand approach
