               Kanésis that focused its activity on nature-derived materials.
               The filaments are the upshot of an original process allowing to
               reuse the surplus of the agricultural supply chains and transform
               it into new sustainable materials. At first, the 3D printed HBPr
               samples were tested in tensile tests according to the ASTMD638
               standard and monitored in term of deformations by the Digital
               Image Correlation techniques (DIC) in order to evaluate the
               stress-strain behavior of different HBPr textures under loading.
               In addition, using the HBPr and the results coming from the
               experimental campaign, the design of an exhibition pavilion was

               analysis is presented on the base of the experimentally
               determined mechanical properties of HBPr elements, under the

               semiconducting (n-type) thermoelectric pastes for building
               components concerning energy-harvesting devices through 3D
               printing, spray and electrospinning were synthetized and tested
               for the first time. The Mg2Si fine powders were obtained through
               the combination of ball milling and thermal annealing under Ar
               atmosphere. While the latter process was crucial for obtaining
               the desired Mg2Si phase, the ball milling was indispensable for
               homogenizing and reducing the grain size of the powders. The
               synthetized Mg2Si powders exhibited a large Seebeck coefficient
               of 487 µV/K and were blended with a polymeric solution in
               different mass ratios to adjust the paste viscosity to the
               different requirements of 3D printing, electrospinning and
               low-pressure spray. The materials produced in every single stage
               of the paste synthesis were characterized by a variety of
               techniques that unequivocally prove their viability for producing
               thermoelectric parts and components. These can certainly trigger
               further research and development in green thermoelectric
               generators (TEGs) capable of adopting any form or shape with
               enhanced thermoelectric properties. These green TEGs are meant to
               compete with common toxic materials such as Bi2Te3, PbTe and CoSb
               that have Seebeck coefficients in the range of 290–700 μV/K,
               similar to that of the produced Mg2Si powders and lower than that
               of 3D printed bulk Mg2Si pieces, measured to be 4866 μV/K. Also,
               their measured thermal conductivities proved to be significantly
               lower ( 0.2 W/mK) than that reported for Mg2Si (≥ 4 W/mK).
               However, it is herein demonstrated that such thermoelectric
               properties are not stable over time. Pressureless sintering
               proved to be indispensable, but difficultly achievable by long
               thermal annealing (even above 32 h) in inert atmosphere at 400
               °C, at least for bulk Mg2Si pieces constituted by a mean grain
               size of 2–3 μm. Hence, for overcoming this sintering challenge
               and become the silicide’s extrusion viable in the production of
               bulk thermoelectric parts, alternative pressureless sintering
               methods will have to be further explored. © 2019, The Author(s).",

               presents an opportunity for utilising materials that are

               Incorporating underutilised solids and/or waste solids as
               aggregates is a way of gaining the maximum environmental and
               economic benefits from the emerging 3D concrete printing
               technology. In this study, desert sand (small size),
               river-sediment ceramsite sand (medium size), and recycled
               concrete (large size) were experimentally investigated for use as
               aggregates in the 3D printing of concrete. Three mixtures were
               designed with continuous, open, and interrupted gradations of
               solids, respectively, based on the theory of particle
               interference, and aiming to meet the requirements of
               extrusion-based 3D printing. The influences of the particle
               grading characteristics on the printability-related early-age
               behaviours, mechanical properties, and shrinkage resistance have
               been measured and analysed. The test results demonstrate that the
               self-supporting skeletal effect formed by the gradated particles
               reduces the flowability of the mixtures, but the structural
               build-up/buildability performance is improved (under the premise
               of the desired printability). The interlayer distribution and
               skeleton of the gradated aggregate contribute to improving the
               interfacial interlocking effect and contact bonding between
               layers; this is visually validated through computed tomography
               (CT) scanning. Further, the addition of aggregates reduces the
               proportion of cementitious composites, and therefore effectively
               mitigates the shrinkage of the cement matrix. The grading
               characteristics of the underutilised particle resources are
               crucial for regulating the early-age 3D printability. This
               article provides feasible solutions based on experimental data
               for promoting the eco-utilisation of underutilised and waste
               solids in 3D printing, and these solutions satisfy the minimum

               three-dimensional (3D)-printed Ti implants mimic the
               microstructure and mechanical properties of natural bones.
               Additionally, eco-friendly techniques based on inorganic-binding
               peptides have been applied to modify Ti surfaces. Herein, in our
               study, Ti surfaces were modified to reinforce osseointegration
               using chimeric peptides constructed by connecting W9, RP1P, and
               minTBP-1 directly or via (GP)4, respectively. PR1P is derived
               from the extracellular VEGF-binding domain of prominin-1, which
               increases the expression of VEGF and promotes the binding of VEGF
               to endothelial cells, thereby accelerating angiogenesis. W9
               induces osteoblast differentiation in bone marrow mesenchymal
               stem cells and human mesenchymal stem cells to promote bone
               formation. Overall, chimeric peptides promote osseointegration by
               promoting angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Additionally, chimeric
               peptides with P3\&4 were more effective than those with P1\&2 in
               improving osseointegration, which might be ascribed to the
               capacity of P3\&4 to provide a greater range for chimeric
               peptides to express their activity. This work successfully used
               chimeric peptides to modify 3D-Ti implant surfaces to improve
               osseointegration on the implant-bone surface. © 2021 American

               offered by 3D printers have driven the amazing increase of these
               technologies in the last years. On the other hand, the

               the potential effects of these technologies in the environment,
               coming from energy consumption, materials, and wastes produced. A

  abstract = "When designing a print product, recyclability used to have little
              priority. In the last years it has become more important. Among
              other factors, the printing process itself is crucial for the
              re-use of a printed product - flexo, UV, inkjet, liquid toners as
              well as some adhesives can be challenges for the production of
              recycled graphic paper. With rising environmental awareness, paper
              recycling becomes a more and more important issue also in
              marketing of printers and - accordingly - in the development of a
              printer. But very little is known about coherences. During the
              recycling process, the ink is separated from the paper fibers
              dissolved in water, and then it has to be removed from the aqueous
              suspension. This is why current inkjet inks are almost impossible
              to deink. Field testing of the deinkability has been done for the
              last decade but without any rating system to evaluate a certain
              printed product. The European Recovered Paper Council (ERPC)
              adopted a Scoring System for Deinkability in 2008. This system is
              based on the evaluation of the deinkability according to INGEDE
              Method 11, a lab procedure that has been developed to evaluate and
              compare the challenge a printed product means for a paper
              recycling mill. In 2009, INGEDE began to establish a certificate
              confirming the deinkability of a printed product, serving frequent
              requests of both authorities and printing as well as printer
              industry. The certificate has already been accepted by the
              Austrian Consumer Organization VKI who was the first to include
              deinkability into the criteria for their eco-label for printed
              products. The underlying procedure for deinkability testing is
              INGEDE Method 11. Occasionally is being discussed whether it is
              relevant for all deinking processes, not only in Europe, also in
              the US. The procedure allows a solid assessment under standard
              conditions but is not meant to simulate every detail of a deinking

               full-color 3D printing as an example. By measuring the

               (3D) net-like magnetic mesoporous carbon (MMC) by an eco-friendly
               and low-cost method. These mesoporous (3.90-7.68 nm) composites
               have a high specific surface area (287-423 m2 g-1),
               well-developed porosity (0.24-0.74 cm3 g-1) and abundant

               avoid the entry of this toxic pollutant into the ecosystem.
               Therefore, we developed a low-cost graphene (Gr)-printed paper
               electrode for determination of H2O2 using cyclic voltammetry
               (CV). An office inkjet-printer and Gr nano-ink stabilized with
               ethyl cellulose (EC) were used for the fabrication of printed
               paper electrodes (PPEs) to determine H2O2 quantitatively. A
               stable Gr-EC nano-ink (2\%) with viscosity and surface tension
               values of 12 mPa S-1 and 35 mN M-1, respectively, was formulated
               to obtain conductive electrodes. A wide linear range (2 μM-25 mM)
               with a better limit of detection (0.28 μM) for the determination
               of H2O2 was obtained when the Gr-EC/PPE was used as a working
               electrode. Further, the Gr-EC/PPE was successfully employed for
               analysis of H2O2 in wastewater. The electrochemical determination
               of H2O2 using the Gr-EC/PPE as an electrode in CV is rapid,
               economical, flexible and eco-friendly when compared with
               previously reported methods. © 2022 The Royal Society of

               construction industry has a wide range of advantages from the
               economic, social and design flexibility point of view. However,
               most of up to date research studies have been performed using
               ordinary Portland cement (OPC)-based mortars and concretes.
               Therefore, the objective of this article is to explore the
               development of an eco-friendly earth composite reinforced with
               natural sisal fibers and chemically stabilized with a hydraulic
               binder. Analysis of the workability by shear vane tests was
               performed on fresh earth samples to find the optimum water
               content in sisal fiber-reinforced earth stabilized with OPC.
               Afterward, the effect of the addition of OPC on the hardening
               process was evaluated through shear vane and Vicat needle tests
               from 0 to 180 min after mixing. The results indicate that water
               content, fiber addition and OPC replacement have a strong
               influence on the shear yield strength. Furthermore, the presence
               of chemical stabilizers as OPC accelerates the hardening process
               allowing a faster layer-by-layer deposition. This low cost and
               eco-friendly preliminary earth-based composite can be used for 3D
               printing applications in the construction industry. © Published

               effective disposal of the product by eco-friendly methods from
               its inception to its end of life. The overall picture currently
               shows that regulatory authorities have increased the number of
               regulations without offering additional benefits, the cost of
               technology acquisition to optimize processes is exceptionally
               high and the enforcement level is very low due to easy handling.
               While managers report increased efficiency after implementation,
               economic and financial benefits remain the focus. Some hurdles
               that delay the implementation of GSCM processes include lack of
               knowledge and expertise, resistance to technological advances,
               lack of government support, customer awareness, cost implications
               and uncertain events. Includes lack of knowledge and expertise,
               resistance to technological advances, lack of government support,
               customer awareness, cost implications and uncertain events that
               delay the implementation of GSCM processes. Companies are certain
               to achieve long-term benefits through the use of new and advanced
               technologies such as IoT, AI, Big Data, additive manufacturing
               and cloud computing to overcome these obstacles. In this paper,
               we introduce a model that makes it easier to implement GSCM
               processes by considering key variables for companies that want to
               optimize their processes. Identification of factors influencing
               GSCM. These variables have been operationalized taking into
               account the management of technology. These variables were
               implemented taking into account how technology management will
               help us to improve these factors. To prepare a model to help
               predict the implementation of the GSCM, a questionnaire was
               prepared to affect the current scenario in general. The model was
               developed following a survey consisting of responses from key
               elements of the supply chain management hierarchy. Most important
               variables included technology, policies and the average length of
               the supply chain as well as some interaction effects. Using this
               model, GSCM processes can be easily implemented on a scale of
               1-5, 1–very difficult and 5–very easy. This research was
               conducted at an intermediate level and can pave the way for
               future researchers to develop a better model that can help
               predict the implementation of green processes in their supply

               allocating resources efficiently to the manufacturing industry to
               optimize its processes. This will help to achieve minimum
               regulatory requirements and achieve competitive advantages for

               and inkjet-printed electrochemical sensors could be the answer.
               Inkjet printing is a well-known technology that has been
               revisited in recent years, using silver nanoparticle (AgNP) based
               inks for low-cost and easy fabrication of sensing and biosensing
               systems on flexible and eco-compatible substrates. In this

               both interdigitated electrodes arrays (IDEAs), and a versatile
               system to monitor bacterial cultures by electrochemical impedance
               spectroscopy (EIS). In particular, we studied this biosensing
               system for the detection of bacteriophages by comparing its

               filler for polymer composites is pozzolan. In this study, the
               optimization of the formulations and processing parameters of
               composites produced with pozzolan and bio-based polyethylene for
               3D printing technology was performed. Furthermore, a precision
               irrigation system in the form of a drip watering cup was
               designed, printed, and characterized. The results showed that the
               presence of the pozzolan acted as a reinforcement for the
               composite material and improved the cohesion between the layers
               of the 3D printed objects. Furthermore, the optimization of the
               process conditions made it possible to print pieces of complex
               geometry and permeable parts for the control of the water flow
               rates with an order of magnitude in the range from mL/h to

               electrical properties of carbon additives with the benefits of
               thermoplastics, has emerged as a promising route towards rapid
               and low-cost manufacturing of customised-shaped electronic
               devices with minimised waste. However, their poor electrical
               activity in their pristine state makes activation post-treatments
               mandatory to reduce the amount of insulating polymer. These
               post-treatments typically involve the use of toxic organic
               solvents or costly thermal annealing methods. Herein, a simple
               eco-friendly wet-chemical post-treatment is presented for the
               quick and general activation of carbon-based 3D printed
               electronic devices by employing reducing agents like ascorbic
               acid or sodium borohydride. We tested a range of reducing agents,
               such as sodium borohydride, lithium aluminium hydride, hydrazine
               and ascorbic acid, as well as a model oxidising agent like
               hydrogen peroxide. We found that ascorbic acid and sodium

               electrically active devices while preserving the shape and
               structure of the 3D printed carbon objects. Thus, this work

  abstract  = "Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology is actively utilized
               in various industrial fields because it facilitates effective and
               customizable fabrication of complex structures. An important
               processing route for 3D printing is the extrusion of inks in the
               form of colloidal suspensions or emulsions, which has recently
               attracted considerable attention because it allows for selection
               of a wide range of printing materials and is operable under
               ambient processing conditions. Herein, we investigate the 3D
               printability of complex fluids containing chlorella microalgae as
               an eco-friendly material for 3D printing. Two possible ink types
               are considered: aqueous chlorella suspensions and emulsions of
               oil and water mixtures. While the aqueous chlorella suspensions
               at high particle loading display the 3D-printable rheological
               properties such as high yield stress and good shape retention,
               the final structures after extruding and drying the suspensions
               under ambient conditions show a significant number of macroscopic
               defects, limiting their practical application. In contrast, the
               3D structures produced from the oil-in-water Pickering emulsions
               stabilized by chlorella microalgae, which are amphiphilic and
               active at the oil–water interface, show significantly reduced
               defect formation. Addition of a fast-evaporable oil phase,
               hexane, is crucial in the mechanisms of enhanced cementation
               between the individual microalgae via increased inter-particle
               packing, capillary attraction, and hydrophobic interaction.
               Furthermore, addition of solid paraffin wax, which is crystalline
               but well-soluble in the hydrocarbon oil phase under ambient
               conditions, completely eliminates the undesirable defect
               formation via enhanced inter-particle binding, while maintaining
               the overall rheological properties of the emulsion. The optimal
               formulation of the Pickering emulsion is finally employed to
               produce a 3D scaffold of satisfactory structural integrity,
               suggesting that the chlorella-based ink, in the form of an
               emulsion, has potential as an eco-friendly 3D printing ink

               biomaterials and cells for the repair or replacement of injured
               tissues and organs. A common challenge for 3D bioprinting
               materials is that the structures printed from the biodegradable
               polymer hydrogels tend to collapse because of the poor mechanical
               stability. In this study, dual stimuli-responsive biodegradable
               polyurethane (PU) dispersions (PUA2 and PUA3) were synthesized
               from an eco-friendly waterborne process. Acrylate group was
               introduced in the PU chain end to serve as a photosensitive
               moiety for UV-induced cross-linking and improvement of the
               printability, while mixed oligodiols in the soft segment remained
               to be the thermosensitive moiety. The photo/thermal-induced
               morphological changes of PU nanoparticles were verified by
               dynamic light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, and
               rheological measurement of the dispersions. It was observed that
               these PU nanoparticles became more rod-like in shape after UV
               treatment and formed compact packing structures upon further
               heating. With the thermosensitive properties, these UV-cured PU
               dispersions underwent rapid thermal gelation with gel moduli in
               the range 0.5-2 kPa near body temperature. The rheological
               properties of the PU hydrogels including dynamic viscoelasticity,
               creep recovery, and shear thinning behavior at 37 °C were
               favorable for processing by microextrusion-based 3D printing and
               could be easily mixed with cells before printing to produce
               cell-laden constructs. The dual-responsive hydrogel constructs
               demonstrated higher resolution and shape fidelity as well as
               better cell viability and proliferation than the thermoresponsive
               control. Moreover, the softer hydrogel (PUA3) with a low modulus
               (<1 kPa) could offer neural stem cells a tofu-like, stable, and
               inductive 3D microenvironment to proliferate and differentiate.
               We expect that the photo/thermoresponsive biodegradable
               polyurethane ink may offer unique rheological properties to
               contribute toward the custom-made bioprinting of soft tissues.

               customer sustainability perception of plastics, and the eruption
               of new processes (such 3D printing) and materials (such as
               renewably sourced resins). To enable a fast transition to
               high-quality, sustainable plastic applications, a specific
               methodology could be a key competitive advantage. This novel
               methodology is focused on improving the objectivity and
               efficiency of plastic production and the design review process.
               It is applicable to discrete optimization events in any product
               lifecycle milestone, from concept design to serial production
               stages. The methodology includes a natural way to capture
               plastic-related knowledge and trends, oriented towards building a
               dynamic “interaction matrix”, with a list of potential
               optimizations and their positive or negative impacts in a
               comprehensive set of multi-criteria evaluations. With an
               innovative approach, the matrix allows the possibility to
               incorporate a business strategy, which could be different at
               every lifecycle stage. The business strategy is translated from
               the common “verbal” definition into a quantitative set of “Target
               and Restrictions”, making it possible to detect and prioritize
               the best potential design optimization changes according to the
               strategy. This methodology helps to model and compare design
               alternatives, verify impacts in every evaluation criteria, and
               make robust and objective information-based decisions. The
               application of the methodology in real cases of plastic material
               design optimization in the automotive industry has provided
               remarkable results, accelerating the detection of improvement
               methods aligned with the strategy and maximizing the improvement
               in product competitiveness and sustainability. In comparison with
               the simultaneous application of existing mono-criteria
               optimization methodologies (such as “Design to Cost” or “Eco
               Design”) and subjective expert-based reviews, the novel
               methodology has a reduced workload and risks, confirming its
               potential for future application and further development in other
               polymer-based products, such as consumer goods or packaging. ©

               risks associated with their degradation. Hence, a strong interest
               in biodegradable polymers of natural origin has been increasing,
               for finding alternative materials with adequate mechanical
               properties for geotechnical and geo-environmental applications.
               The main aim of this study is to test a bio-based, biodegradable
               and eco-compatible polymer, able to replace polypropylene and
               other synthetic materials in the production of geosynthetics. For
               this purpose, Poly(lactic acid) or PLA, one of the most common
               bioplastic polymer material commonly used as filament for 3D
               printers, was investigated. The chemical structure of PLA was
               determined by 1H NMR and the optical purity determination by
               polarimetry. PLA filament was used to print samples of uniaxial
               and biaxial geogrid at 1:5 scale using a professional 3D printer.
               Subsequently, tensile tests were performed on the filament and on
               prototype geogrids. Tensile tests measured a maximum tensile
               resistance of 51.96 MPa for the filament and 12.96 kN/m for
               uniaxial geogrid prototypes. The mechanical properties of PLA
               were found to be comparable to petroleum derivatives. These
               results are encouraging and can support the utilization of PLA
               for innovative biodegradable geosynthetics production, which
               could represent an alternative to non-biodegradable products,
               particularly when used in combination with live plants. In view

               practices. This system support can be enhanced by using the
               upcoming emerging technologies of Cloud computing, Web 2.0,
               Service Oriented Architecture and Mobile technologies. This
               chapter aims to incorporate these emerging technologies within
               Green ICT systems to help organizations be environmentally
               responsible. Green ICT can be considered as the adoption of an
               eco-friendly process by an organization in its practice of
               Information and Communication Technologies. The last decade, in
               particular, has seen profound awareness on the part of
               individuals as well as organizations in being environmentally
               aware. While automation and related computing activities continue
               to lead to exponential use of energy quotient, at the same time,
               Green ICT continues to chip away at the 'resigned' views of the
               decision makers to environmental responsibilities. ICT operates
               at systems level, applications level, at the end-user level
               through the desktops and printers, and at the enterprise level
               through its data centers, servers and other infrastructure. Green
               ICT is all about optimization and improvement of the
               organizational processes without hindering its progress in the
               use of technology and simultaneously minimizing the
               organizational impact on the environment. This chapter will
               discuss the context provided by ICT in introducing an
               organization to a Green ICT system and explaining a detailed
               architecture and design of such a system. The issues discussed

               and attitudes and policies of decision makers and how they

               increase of complexity of the products. At the same time, it is
               becoming more and more difficult to justify the expected product
               features while satisfying the requirements of the trends like
               eco-design, resource efficiency, light weight design and
               individualization. These developments are key characteristics
               which favor the growing role and importance of additive
               manufacturing (AM). Additive Manufacturing techniques such as
               Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)
               or Selective Laser Melting (SLM) are transitions from building
               prototypes to manufacturing series products within short time and
               with highest requirements regarding material characteristics as
               well as product performance. Product performance is one of the
               main drivers of the creation of multi-material composites. These
               composites, existing of a matrix and embedded fibers, are more
               and more used in various industries not just the aerospace and
               automotive industry. They offer a solution to the light-weight
               requirements amongst others. Yet, so far the manufacturing of
               composites is only partially automated; it requires a lot of
               manual labor and is typically requiring tools resulting in added
               costs. A combination or integration of additive and composite
               manufacturing is very limited to not existing, being an indicator
               for the difficulties to bring these two technologies together. To

               improvement to higher speed range for heavy duty use with low

               sustainability of the global environment in addition to
               minimization of production cost. The digital eco-factory has been
               proposed for a simultaneous examination of environmental
               performance, productivity and manufacturability. This paper
               entertains how to construct the digital eco-factory with high
               accuracy and usability. In general, the digital eco-factory is
               constructed on the virtual production line modelling an actual
               production line and its components. A multi-agent based
               construction of the digital eco-factory was applied and a trial
               digital eco-factory has been implemented for a PCA (Printed
               Circuit Assembly) line. A PCA line consists of a solder paste
               printer, two or three electronic part mounters, reflow soldering
               oven and testing machine. In the PCA line, processes for the
               above machines proceed in sequence, these machines' capabilities
               are modelled as individual machine agents. There are several
               types of printed boards produced, depending on the number of
               mounted electronic components and the temperature of the solder.
               When a blank PCB (Printed Circuit Board) is input to a solder
               paste printing machine, the production process is started. A PCB
               is modelled as a part agent which is one of the product agents.
               For some example virtual productions, power consumption of each
               machine on each line from the environmental view and productivity
               of each machine and each line are monitored. From the results of
               the trial implementation, it can be said that all components on
               the production line could be configured as software agents with
               required accuracy. These agents are called ``machine agents.'' In
               addition to machine agents, manufactured products such as
               workpiece and parts are also configured as software agents. ©

               been developed. Humanoid robotic hands are one of the most useful
               parts to assist humans efficiently. While sensing pressure or

               sensing chemicals is less widely studied despite the significant
               importance. Here, a unique platform of smartly moving humanoid

               printed with disposable and biocompatible cellulose conductive
               ink materials. Rf intensity change of the sensor with NH4 +
               membrane depends on NH4 + ion concentration where R² is 0.9576.
               The smart bending motion of a finger is accomplished by logically

               and sustainable approach for coral fabrication by merging
               three-dimensional (3D) scanning, 3D printing, and molding
               techniques. Our method, 3D CoraPrint, exploits the 3D printing

               expediting the growth rate of live coral fragments and quickening
               the reef transplantation process while minimizing nursery costs.
               It allows for flexibility, customization, and fast return time
               with an enhanced level of accuracy, thus establishing an
               environmentally friendly, scalable model for coral fabrication to
               boost restorative efforts around the globe. © 2021 American

               ambient air conditions by imprinting a pattern onto the PET

               Currently, 3D printing processing technology for ceramic shaping
               generally employs laser beam, ultraviolet (UV) or visible curable
               resins to maintain shape. Here, a novel 3D printing of alumina

               that the paste displays a pseudoplastic fluid characteristic,
               which is suitable for 3D printing. The optimized heat-induced
               paste shows that when the temperature is over 65 °C, the paste

               Transitioning from the visualization and prototyping stages into
               functional and actual part replacement opens further design
               possibilities. Among the diverse applications of AM, construction

               widely used product in the market. Nevertheless, it has been a
               subject of interest to researchers in recent decades. There are

               large-scale construction. Therefore, progress in their
               commercialization seems to proceed at a slow pace, as only a few
               3DP trials for large-scale construction can be found in the

               roughness of these components. It is known that various
               parameters, such as the type of electrolyte solution, the voltage
               or current applied, the treatment time, agitation, etc. They
               could affect the effectiveness of the electropolishing treatment.
               The most used electrolyte solutions are dangerous to handle and
               difficult and expensive to dispose of. The aim of this work was
               to study a possible electropolishing treatment on Ti6Al4V samples

               which cannot meet the green and sustainable development needs of
               modern building materials. Geopolymer is an environmentally
               friendly materials that can utilize industrial solid wastes and
               have low environmental load and energy consumption, which is
               expected to become a substitute for OPC. However, geopolymers
               also have shortcomings in some properties that need to be
               improved. This paper reviews the recent research progress on the
               performance improvement, potential new applicationw and
               sustainability assessment of geopolymer materials. Discussion
               from this paper showed that the properties of geopolymer
               materials, including rheology, hardening properties, toughness,
               etc., can be significantly improved by some methods such as
               chemical additives, mineral admixtures, nanoparticles, fibers,

               produced by Gram-negative bacteria, are typical signaling
               molecules in quorum sensing (QS) systems. Importantly, AHLs play
               a key role in determining the virulence of foodborne pathogens
               and reflect the activity of spoilage bacteria. In this study, an
               eco-friendly fluorescence-sensing platform for the rapid and
               sensitive detection of AHLs was developed and characterized.
               Molecularly imprinted polymers embedded with yellow-emitting
               carbon quantum dots (CQDs) were obtained via the sol-gel process
               using furanone as an alternative template molecule, and
               long-wave-emitting CQDs with excellent optical properties were
               used as signal conversion materials. After template elution, the
               blotting cavities on the surface of the CQD@MIPs (molecularly
               imprinted polymers) were able to selectively recognize AHLs,
               demonstrating a stronger fluorescence response compared with the
               corresponding CQD@NIPs (non-imprinted polymers). Under optimal
               test conditions, a good linear relationship between the
               concentration of analyte and the relative fluorescence intensity
               of the CQD@MIPs was observed. The linear detection range was
               0–2.0 μM, and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.067 μM.
               Importantly, the proposed sensing platform functioned as an
               optical detection strategy that responded quickly (2 min) to
               AHLs. Additionally, this sensing platform was applied to the
               analysis of AHLs in bacterial supernatant samples with
               satisfactory results. More interestingly, the 3D-printing
               CQD@MIPs were tentative explored in this work, which was
               personalized and portable, has an advantage of point of care
               testing (POCT) detection in the future. Based on these results,
               this detection strategy has demonstrated substantial potential

               attracted immense significance due to government policies and
               societal demand for environmental consciousness. However, to
               enhance the financial and ecological impact of the network, the
               forward and reverse supply chain networks must integrate well so
               that decisions taken in both areas complement each other. In this
               study, we propose an eco-efficient CLSC design for extending the
               existing supply chain of an Indian firm that assembles inkjet
               printers. The network design is configured as a multi-objective
               model in a multi-period setting and is mathematically formulated
               into a mixed integer programming problem with fuzzy objectives.
               Fuzziness provides flexibility to the decision makers because
               they must accommodate the conflicting nature of the objectives.
               The fuzzy multi-objective model incorporates the firm's economic
               and environmental concerns into the decision making process by
               selecting environmentally responsible suppliers to procure
               components based on sustainable criteria, choosing appropriate
               recovery options for end-of-use (EOU) inkjet printers, and
               planning an efficient transportation network design for reducing
               the carbon emission of the distribution and collection
               activities. The uniqueness of the proposed fuzzy CLSC
               optimization model lies in providing an integrated decision
               making framework that can aid the manufacturer in making crucial
               strategic, tactical, and operational decisions of optimal
               selection of suppliers, component order allocation, recovery flow
               allocation, and vehicle routing planning. The novelty of the
               model also lies in simultaneously minimising the overall cost of
               the activities undertaken, maximizing the performance of the
               component suppliers and minimising the carbon emissions of the
               associated transportation activities. A weighted fuzzy
               mathematical programming approach is utilised for generating a
               fuzzy, properly efficient solution as the desired compromised
               solution for the CLSC network problem configuration. The
               relevance of the model is justified using a real data set derived
               from a case study of the firm based in the northern capital
               region (NCR) of India. The findings indicate that the proposed

               sustainably from the numerous electronic product reuse
               opportunities in the Indian market. Further, while costly to
               begin with, choosing suppliers with higher sustainable
               performance and vehicles with lesser emission rate could
               substantially enhance firm's sustainable image and result in
               higher profits in the future. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

               which enable them to be used for numerous applications due to
               their flexibility, light weight, low noise, and many degrees of
               freedom. Mechanical actuators, such as pneumatic actuators and
               servomotors, introduce design constraints related to their size,
               weight, and cost. Moreover, vibration and noise are undesired
               attributes that preclude the use of robots developed with such
               technologies and might disturb the test environment. This paper
               presents a robust design of a jellyfish-like robot with eight

               actuators confined in a conduit and activated by electrical
               current stimulation. KryptoJelly is constructed from a 3D printed
               rigid structure and a soft silicone bell that closely mimics the
               biological locomotion and appearance of a jellyfish found in
               nature; the Chrysaora colorata species. Four 127 μm diameter SMA
               wires (of mass 14 mg each) were used per channel to deform the
               silicone bell margin. The robot can operate up to 1608 cycles

               higher than the standard) and sustain its own total body mass of
               650 g (∼6000 times the weight of the actuators used). KryptoJelly
               is able to maneuver in both vertical and horizontal directions

               coordination compounds, which are different from most reported
               “traditional” materials such as plasmonic particles,

               manufacturing (AM) has increased. Taking into account
               environmental problems and sustainability, manufacturers are now
               also considering the environmental and sustainability criteria in
               their decision-making process. The sustainability concept is
               known as the triple-bottom line, namely, economic, social and
               environmental perspectives. Sustainable concept selection in the
               manufacturing organisation can be considered as the selection of
               sustainable material, product design, process, method and
               technology. This study aims to select an appropriate AM process
               by considering sustainability from various available techniques.
               Design/methodology/approach: Appropriate sustainable performance
               indicators for the AM were identified based on literature as well
               as in discussion with experts and decision-makers. The model
               addresses all the major dimensions of sustainable concepts of AM
               such as material/product quality, machine performance, market
               stability, total cost and ecological values. A hybrid
               multi-criteria decision-making approach, i.e. stepwise weight
               assessment ratio analysis and complex proportional assessment
               methods, have been used to select the best AM technique. While
               selecting criteria affecting AM machines and processes, criteria
               based on the sustainable concept are considered. Findings: Among
               the four selected AM processes, i.e. fused diffusion modelling
               (FDM), laminated object manufacturing (LOM), stereolithography
               apparatus (SLA) and selective laser sintering (SLS), the best
               alternative was found to be FDM. Research
               limitations/implications: The present study highlights some
               limitations in the selection of AM process and methodology used
               in this research. This study considers only four AM processes,
               i.e. FDM, LOM, SLA and SLS. Future work may include considering
               other AM processes and criteria that affect the sustainability of
               AM. Practical implications: The present work will help
               researchers and production managers to decide the best AM
               alternatives to fabricate desired parts. Hence, AM can help in
               maximum energy utilisation, optimal consumption of resources,
               minimum material wastage and reduction of CO2 emission.
               Originality/value: The study considers some important criteria,
               including energy consumption, eco-friendly and wastage-free
               production, that help sustainable AM. This study can result in a
               good economic efficiency of AM industries and, therefore,

               limited resources. Microbial electrochemical cell-based (MXC)

               extracted from B. mori silkworm cocoons. It has been used by the
               textile industry for thousands of years. With increasing needs
               for implantable and degradable biomaterials, SF textile material
               has attracted more and more interests in the biomedical field,
               due to its excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability,
               non-immunogenicity and sufficient supply. Moreover, it can be
               combined with other biomaterials to form biopolymer composites
               with unique performance. The versatility and sustainability of SF
               fibers-based biomedical textile material provides new research
               ideas and solutions for tailoring biomaterials to meet specific
               biomedical applications via eco-friendly approaches. The natural
               SF fiber can be obtained by degumming the cocoons, and after
               being dissolved, the regenerated SF solution can be obtained.
               Then, the regenerated SF solution can further prepare the
               regenerated SF fiber by different molding methods. According to
               the practical application requirements in the field of
               biomedicine, SF fibers can be made into one-dimensional,
               two-dimensional or three-dimensional biomedical textiles by
               various techniques such as weaving, knitting, non-woven,
               electrospinning and three-dimensional printing technology, which
               have broad application prospects in biomedical fields such as
               tissue engineering, drug delivery and biosensors. However, there
               are still some disadvantages in the mechanical properties and
               persistence of SF textile materials, beyond that the specific
               biofunctionality is not excellent such as blood solubility, cell
               adhesion, osseointegration and cell differentiation. Therefore,
               the application of silk fibroin textile materials in the
               biomedical field is limited to some extent. In order to expand
               the application of SF textile materials in the biomedical field,
               it is usually necessary to enhance the inherent function or
               introduce new functions of SF textile materials through
               functional modification while retaining its intrinsic properties.
               At present, there are four main methods for functional
               modification of SF materials, including intrinsic functional
               modification, surface modification of SF fiber, blending
               modification with other functional fiber, directly mixing before
               regenerated SF solution spinning. The functionally modified SF
               materials can effectively guide cell response and functional
               expression, enhance mechanical properties, and achieve the
               purpose of promoting wound healing and tissue organ repair. This
               paper mainly reviews the recent advances in the development of
               one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three-dimensional SF-based
               textile materials in the biomedical fields. And the structure and
               basic properties of SF materials are introduced, the functional
               modification methods of SF-based textile materials are

               societies are invited to switch to a resilient and circular
               economic model. In this context, this work proposes a method to
               manufacture piezoelectric devices made from agro-resources such
               as tartaric acid and polylactide, thereby significantly reducing
               the energy budget without requiring any sophisticated equipment.
               These piezoelectric devices are manufactured by liquid-phase
               epitaxy-grown Rochelle salt (RS) crystals in a 3D-printed
               poly(Lactic acid) (PLA) matrix, which is an artificial squared
               mesh which mimics anatomy of natural wood. This composite
               material can easily be produced in any fablab with renewable
               materials and at low processing temperatures, which reduces the
               total energy consumed. Manufactured biodegradable samples are
               fully recyclable and have good piezoelectric properties without
               any poling step. The measured piezoelectric coefficients of
               manufactured samples are higher than many piezoelectric polymers

               The structures involved in the test were manufactured using 3D
               printing technique. Four configurations with different number of
               cells in the core, were tested. It is found that sandwiches with
               high number of cells are stiffer and dissipate more energy.
               Experimental tests were monitored with acoustic emission
               technique in order to detect the appearance and the evolution of
               damage behavior. An unsupervised pattern recognition algorithm
               was used to post process the acoustic emission signals. The
               classification is conducted using k-means algorithm. Results show
               that there are three different classes of events for each
               configuration, which are the core cracking, the matrix cracking

               Furthermore, the photophysical and photodynamic properties of the

              Product take-back programs set up reverse logistics processes for
              such owners to return equipment they no longer want. In the
              electronics industry, generally these programs are run by specific
              manufacturers, but any brand of equipment can be returned. Due to
              this spurt in end-of-life product recycling programs a new problem

              electronic product, characterized by different model, year, brand,

              sustainable and environmentally sound product recycling these
              products have to be first disassembled and recycled for material
              recovery. Recyclers are also required to ensure that hazardous
              waste is treated separately while recycling. Lack of information
              on disassembly methods and material information on these products
              could lead to incoherent decisions. This could affect profit
              margins as well as lead to inappropriate end-of-life treatment. An
              information system is therefore needed to aid decision making for
              adopting best possible end-of-life strategy for electronic
              products. Proposed system provides easy access to recyclers on

               years, printed batteries are being intensively developed by 3D
               printing technologies, where further developments in ink
               properties, compatibility with the manufacturing process and
               integration with devices are still required. In this context, the
               future challenges in the area of printed batteries are also
               presented and discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

               efficiency by eliminating the concept of waste and leading to a
               shift away from the linear take-make-waste model. In a CE,
               resources are flowing in a circular manner either in a biocycle
               (biomass) or technocycle (inorganic materials). While early
               studies indicate that 3D printing (3DP) holds substantial promise
               for sustainability and the creation of a CE, there is no
               guarantee that it will do so. There is great uncertainty
               regarding whether the current trajectory of 3DP adoption is
               creating more circular material flows or if it is leading to an
               alternative scenario in which less eco-efficient localised
               production, demands for customised goods, and a higher rate of
               product obsolescence combine to bring about increased resource
               consumption. It is critical that CE principles are embedded into
               the new manufacturing system before the adoption of 3DP reaches a
               critical inflection point in which negative practices become
               entrenched. This paper, authored by both academic and industry
               experts, proposes a research agenda to determine enablers and
               barriers for 3DP to achieve a CE. We explore the two following
               overarching questions to discover what specific issues they
               entail: (1) How can a more distributed manufacturing system based
               on 3DP create a circular economy of closed-loop material flows?
               (2) What are the barriers to a circular 3D printing economy? We
               specifically examine six areas—design, supply chains, information
               flows, entrepreneurship, business models and education—with the
               aim of formulating a research agenda to enable 3DP to reach its
               full potential for a CE. © 2016",

               characterization, PLA-fused filament was successfully deposed
               onto jute fabrics to print dog-bone tensile specimens (Type I
               specimen from ASTM D638). The jute fabrics were chemically
               modified, treated with flame retardant additives, and sprayed
               with aerosol adhesive to improve the mechanical properties of
               PLA/Jute fabric composites. The elastic modulus and the strength
               of PLA were higher than PLA composites, and the plastic
               deformation of the PLA composites was slightly lower than PLA.
               Tomography scans revealed the fabrics were well oriented and some
               adherence between jute fabrics and PLA. Viscoelastic properties
               of PLA composites resulted in the reduction in storage modulus
               and the reduction in intensity in the damping factor attributed
               to segmental motions with no variations in the glass transition

               promoted better response to time of burning than PLA and PLA with

  abstract = "In the full color laser printers and copiers, the performance
              features of high print speed, fine image quality and environmental
              friendliness are required. Therefore the special toner also has
              been required for high speed printing and fine image quality.
              Recently many chemically prepared toners (CPTs) have been
              proposed, and these toners are suitable to achieve small and
              narrow particle size distribution. But most of these toners use
              styrene acrylic resin, and only a few toners use polyester which
              is superior to styrene acrylic resin in low-energy fusing. But due
              to the use of organic solvents in the manufacturing process,
              environmental friendliness remains a matter for improvement in
              polyester CPTs. We reported a novel PES CPT without using any
              solvent in the manufacturing process at NIP27 and NIP28. In this
              study, three technologies for advanced PES CPT were described. 1)
              To develop polyester chemically prepared toner which has larger
              fusing latitudes for full color printers, we developed a
              technology to cross-link polyester with oxazoline polymer. 2) To
              develop eco-friendly polyester chemically prepared toner for
              low-energy fusing, we tried to introduce crystalline polyester by
              emulsification in aqueous phase. It was found that crystalline
              polyester could be emulsified successfully in the presence of
              amorphous polyester which makes crystalline part soluble with
              amorphous part. 3) We have found it is possible to make a toner
              having coreshell structure in which the core contains crystalline
              polyester for low-temperature fusing and the shell uses seed
              polymerization of styrene for storage stability. In this seed
              polymerization process, styrene monomer was reacted and
              cross-linked with the polyester of surface of the toner particles.
              The shell made by seed polymerization is suitable to be insoluble
              with polyester core. From this study, we could obtain a toner
              having core-shell structure in which the core contained
              crystalline polyester and the shell contained amorphous polyester
              cross-linked by styrene. Furthermore, the toner provided improved
              performance in storage stability and low-temperature fusing.

               a scalable and eco-friendly solution to sensing and energy
               harvesting applications. Piezoelectric polymers such as PVDF are
               particularly interesting because of the possibility to engineer
               the performance of these materials through addition of
               higher-performance piezoelectric inclusions and nanomaterials and
               to scalably manufacture such composites by emerging techniques
               such as 3D printing. This work makes two contributions, namely
               towards composite design and towards development of accurate
               effective property models. In the context of composite design, we
               evaluate the piezoelectric performance of PVDF modified by the
               addition of polycrystalline-BaTiO3 and multiwalled carbon
               nanotubes. Firstly, the addition of BaTiO3 dramatically improves
               the electric field within the composite offering significant
               advantages specially at low BaTiO3 concentrations. Secondly, the
               addition of carbon nanotubes to the matrix, particularly at
               higher BaTiO3 loadings, leads to an order of magnitude increase
               in the piezoelectric flux generation. Further enhancement in the
               flux generation is also possible by tuning the polycrystallinity
               of the BaTiO3 inclusions. However, these behaviours are
               inclusion-driven and the piezoelectric behaviour of the matrix
               does not contribute to this improvement. Importantly, a small
               addition of BaTiO3 and CNT into the PVDF matrix, away from
               percolation, can simultaneously improve flux and electric field
               generation. In this part of the work, we assume an isotropic PVDF
               matrix. Given that PVDF is elastically anisotropic, the second
               aspect of this work is the development of an effective property
               model for CNT-modified PVDF, taking into account the elastic
               anisotropy of poled PVDF, to predict the elastic coefficients of
               CNT-modified PVDF matrices, thus undertaking a key step towards
               modelling anisotropic piezoelectric composites. We show that the
               anisotropy-based model makes similar predictions in the effective
               composite behaviour, indicating that in the case of PVDF-based
               piezocomposites, the anisotropy of the matrix does not
               significantly affect the piezoresponse. © 2019 IOP Publishing

              platform to re-assert their status in the management hierarchy. It

              was re-empowered to drive through changes.The economy is looking

               the last few decades, becoming an important issue nowadays. The
               eco-aware everyday things were devised to prevent the waste of
               energy resources in common areas where people often elude their
               responsibility about the energy consumption when using appliances
               of collective use, like printers, coffee makers, beamers and so
               on. These eco-appliances are able to improve their energy
               efficiency dynamically adapting their operation according to
               their usage patterns. This work proposes a further step, also
               aligned with devices' automation, where everyday consumer devices
               are transformed into collaborative eco-aware everyday things.
               Taking advantage of the evolution of the Internet towards the
               Internet of Things and the Web as a universal communication
               mechanism both among humans-to-things and things-to-things, it is

               the cold-start problem, which is common in scenarios where usage

               alternative processes have been proposed to replace them. The
               major requirement for such an alternative process is that it does
               not require a mask, it must be capable of being processed at room
               temperature, and it needs to be an eco-friendly process. Photo
               electrophoretic deposition is a promising process that has
               various advantages, but it needs nanoscale movement of the
               reaction cell. In this study, a disposable nanoactuator was
               designed and manufactured to utilize the photo electrophoretic
               deposition process. In designing the nanoactuator, it is possible

              and carbon black as the essential pigment. Market forces driving
              this evolution and increasing additive diversity are the demand
              for high speed office printers and commercial digital presses and
              the need for low priced laser printers to make small office and

              on environmentally safe raw materials. Novel fumed

               electricity providers. In order to enhance workers’ energy

               projectors, coffee-makers, printers, screens, portable fans,
               kettles, and so on) into persuasive eco-aware everyday things.
               The proposed approach lets these appliances report their usage
               patterns to a Cloud-server where the data are transformed into
               time-series and then processed to obtain the appliances’
               next-week usage forecast. Autoregressive integrated moving

               limited in the cases of volumetric muscle loss. Several

               this capacity, as well as to structurally and mechanically

               microenvironment of the tissue in terms of parallel-aligned
               structure and biophysical signals were shown to be effective. In
               this study, we have developed 3D printed aligned and electrically
               active scaffolds in which the electrical conductivity was
               provided by carbonaceous material (CM) derived from algae-based
               biomass. The synthesis of this conductive and functional CM
               consisted of eco-friendly synthesis procedure such as
               pre-carbonization and multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)
               catalysis. CM obtained from biomass via hydrothermal
               carbonization (CM-03) and its ash form (CM-03K) were doped within
               poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) matrix and 3D printed to form
               scaffolds with aligned fibers for structural biomimicry.
               Scaffolds were seeded with C2C12 mouse myoblasts and subjected to
               electrical stimulation during the in vitro culture. Enhanced

               myotube formation and myotube maturity were significantly

               results have therefore showed that the CM obtained from

               novel printing setup employs a low-cost printer to print a
               plastic-based filament and a conductive silver ink paste
               simultaneously. As there were no printers available in the market
               for this application, the open-source fused filament fabrication
               (FFF) printer was modified to accommodate two extruders mounted
               on the same extruder carriage. Techcon TS250 air pressure
               dispenser was employed for the extrusion of silver ink. Extension
               pieces for the extruder carriage were also 3-D printed using a
               fused deposition modeling (FDM) printer to reduce the production
               costs. A bandstop FSS comprising of square loop elements was
               designed to demonstrate the full fabrication. The FSS operated at
               a central frequency of 2.55 GHz and provided a good angle of
               response with wide bandwidths. Surface profiles of the printed
               FSS and substrate demonstrate the reliable fabrication of the FSS
               design. This full 3-D printing method provides an economical,
               eco-friendly, swift, reliable, and viable substitute for the
               fabrication of FSS designs that could be highly customized in
               terms of fabricating 3-D FSS designs with reliable performances.
               The designs can be printed and deployed to reduce the drop in

  abstract  = "Peoples with lost body parts are increasing in today's world,
               resulting in considerable hikes in health-care costs. Amputations
               are most commonly caused by severe traumas such as those caused
               by accidents or war, congenital deformities, cancers, and other
               medical conditions like as diabetes and peripheral artery
               disease. In this paper, a new design of trans-radial prosthetic
               hand is proposed to replace a functionality and/or appearance of
               the missing body part. The developed design of the prosthetic
               hand is based on the anatomy of a human hand. The dimensions and
               link length ratio which were taken for designing the proposed
               prosthetic hand is referenced from a biological human hand. The
               given joint angles ensure the maximum degree of freedom of the
               prosthetic hand. The joint between two links is a two-point
               contact joint, which significantly reduces the chances of fatigue
               and failure of the hand. The actuation of the distal, proximal
               phalanx of the thumb and the metacarpal phalanx of the thumb are
               independent from each other. The design of the prosthetic hand is
               also printed with the help of a 3D printer for better analysis of
               the proposed work. The material used to 3D print the design is
               PLA material which makes the design lightweight, economic,
               eco-friendly and can be more beneficial to amputee person. © 2021

  abstract  = "The development of genetically modified (GM) insect-resistant
               crops has aroused great public concern about the risks on the
               eco-environment resulting from a release of toxic Cry proteins
               (such as Cry1Ab) to the soil. Therefore, it is of crucial
               importance to measure the Cry proteins level and the GM crops
               content. Here, we have tested for the first time a method that
               uses novel carbon nanospheres (CNPs) label-free
               electrochemiluminescent (ECL) immunosensor for the ultrasensitive
               quantification of Cry1Ab and GM crops. In this work, novel CNPs
               were prepared from printer toner with a very facile approach, and
               linked with anti-Cry1Ab antibodies to modify a golden working
               electrode. The immunoreaction between Cry1Ab and its antibody
               formed an immunocomplex on the bioreceptor region of the sensor,
               which inhibited electron transfer between the electrode surface
               and the ECL substance, leading to a decrease of ECL response.
               Under the optimal conditions, the fabricated label-free ECL
               immunosensor determined Cry1Ab down to 3.0 pg mL−1 within a
               linear range of 0.010−1.0 ng mL−1, showing significant
               improvement of sensitivity than that of most previous reports.
               Meanwhile, the proposed method was successfully applied for GM
               rice BT63 and GM maize MON810 detections down to 0.010\% and
               0.020\%, respectively. Due to its outstanding advantages such as
               high sensitivity, ideal selectivity, simple fabrication, rapid
               detection, and low cost, the developed method can be considered
               as a powerful and pioneering tool for GM crops detection. Its use
               can also be extended to other toxin protein sensing in foods. ©

               on chloride transport and steel corrosion in recycled aggregate
               concrete (RAC) is currently available, but a systematic review
               has been lacking. This paper presents a critical review of
               chloride transport in RAC, and the induced steel corrosion
               behaviour and cracking patterns of reinforced RAC are introduced.
               Related modification methods are further discussed. The results
               showed that the incorporated recycled aggregate (RA) increased
               chloride ingress in RAC, and a time-dependent characteristic was
               observed for the chloride diffusion coefficient. The lower RA
               properties led to higher chloride ingress in preparing RAC when
               RA substitution rates were the same; the induced environmental
               damage accelerated chloride ingress in RAC. Incorporating RA
               increased the steel corrosion risk and shortened the initial
               corrosion time of reinforced RAC, and the cracking pattern of
               reinforced RAC was different from the cracking pattern of
               reinforced natural aggregate concrete. Removing and enhancing the
               adhered old mortar of RA improve the properties of RAC, and
               various modification methods can be employed to improve the
               resistance to chloride ingress and steel corrosion in RAC. In
               particular, a CO2-curing treatment, which is eco-friendly, is
               recommended for improving the RA and RAC properties. The study of

               and miniaturized 3D-printed interface was developed. To evaluate

               concentrations (LC50) of a panel of reference toxicants obtained
               on this system were compared with those from tests using
               conventional static protocols, and were not significantly
               different. Automated behavioral tests were then conducted by
               perfusing toxicants through the chip-based device to dynamically
               assess the effect of toxicants on selected locomotory parameters.
               Results showed that the system was able to detect and
               automatically analyse data to assess changes in the swimming
               behavior of A.compressa at toxicant concentrations that did not
               induce mortality in test populations. For the majority of
               chemical stressors tested, behavioral sub-lethal changes occurred
               early and in a concentration- and exposure time-dependent manner
               and could be recorded with no “observer” input. We postulate that
               integrated Lab-on-a-Chip systems can enable new avenues for
               “Early Warning” biomonitoring systems that can automate the use

               attention as an eco-friendly way to harvest mechanical energy for
               self-powered system. Structural design is crucial for optimizing
               the energy conversion efficiency of PEHs, especially some
               specialized three-dimensional (3D) structures as theoretically
               predicted. However, there are few reports guiding from the
               simulation to the real construction of high performance PEHs, and
               it is usually difficult to use traditional processing methods to
               realize customized 3D designate structures. Herein, the fused
               deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing technique is developed to
               architect four customized 3D PVDF PEHs, and the relationship
               between the designed structures and corresponding piezoelectric
               output performances are systematically studied by theoretical
               simulation. The results show that, with a decreased force-bearing
               area, the effective deformation of the PEHs along the vertical
               direction increases, resulting in an excellent piezoelectric
               output. Thus, the optimal 3D conus arrayed PEH shows the highest
               piezoelectric output voltage of 8.69 V and current of 90.8 nA,
               which is about 2.75 times higher than that of the cylinder
               arrayed one. Additionally, the conus arrayed PEH can fast charge
               a 1 μF capacitor to 2.5 V within 100 s. This work manifests 3D
               printing as a powerful tool to reconcile the simulation and
               architecting for 3D PEHs with enhanced output performance for
               futuristic self-powered systems. © 2021 American Chemical Society",

               ever before. This has led to the development of eco-friendly
               manufacturing systems to replace conventional ones. Additive
               manufacturing (AM) technology, for instance, is expected to
               contribute to reducing material costs and energy consumption.
               Unlike conventional material-cutting manufacturing processes, AM
               enables designs of any shape in manufacturing by adding the
               necessary parts layer by layer. Direct energy deposition (DED) is
               one of the many AM technologies available for a variety of
               commercial steel powders such as P20, P21, SUS420, H13, D2 and
               other Non-ferrous metal powders. The DED is process that can be
               applied to various industries, like molding, medicine, and
               defense. Of these, its application to the molding industry is the
               most practical, since the process can be used to deposit

  abstract  = "Vegetation has been previously proposed as a method for
               protecting artificial and natural slopes against shallow
               landslides (e.g. as may be triggered by an earthquake); however,
               previous research has concentrated on individual root soil
               interaction during shear deformation rather than the global slope
               behaviour due to the extreme expense and difficulty involved in
               conducting full-scale field tests. Geotechnical centrifuge
               modelling offers an opportunity to investigate in detail the
               engineering performance of vegetated slopes, but its application
               has been restricted due to the lack of availability of suitable
               root analogues that can repeatably replicate appropriate
               mechanical properties (stiffness and strength) and realistic 3D
               geometry. This study employed 3D printing to develop a
               representative and repeatable 1:10 scale model of a tree root
               cluster (representing roots up to 1.5 m deep at prototype scale)
               that can be used within a geotechnical centrifuge to investigate
               the response of a vegetated slope subject to earthquake ground
               motion. The printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic
               root model was identified to be highly representative of the
               geometry and mechanical behaviour (stiffness and strength) of
               real woody root systems. A programme of large direct shear tests
               was also performed to evaluate the additional strength provided
               by the root analogues within soil that is slipping and
               investigate the influence of various characteristics (including
               root area ratio (RAR), soil confining effective stress and root
               morphology) on this reinforcing effect. Our results show that
               root reinforcement is not only a function of root mechanical
               properties but also depends on factors including surrounding
               effective confining stress (resulting in depth dependency even
               for the same RAR), depth of the slip plane and root morphology.
               When subject to shear loading in soil, the tap root appeared to
               structurally transfer load within the root system, including to
               smaller and deeper roots which subsequently broke or were pulled
               out. Finally, the root analogues were added to model slopes
               subjected to earthquake ground motion in the centrifuge, where it
               was revealed that vegetation can substantially reduce
               earthquake-induced slope deformation in the soil conditions
               tested (76\% reduction on crest permanent settlement during
               slippage). Both the realistic 3D geometry and highly simplified
               root morphologies, as characterised mechanically by the shear
               tests, were tested in the centrifuge which, despite exhibiting
               very different levels of additional strength in the shear tests,
               resulted in very similar responses of the slopes. This suggests
               that once a certain minimum level of reinforcement has been
               reached which will alter the deformation mechanism within the
               slope, further increases of root contribution (e.g. due to
               differences in root morphology) do not have a large further
               effect on improving slope stability. © 2017, The Author(s).",

               emerging class of devices with high potential for
               electrochemistry. Nevertheless, as-printed electrodes provide
               poor conductivity due to the presence of high amounts of
               insulating thermoplastic material, requiring surface
               post-treatments to enhance their electrochemical performance.
               Such treatments often employ non-eco-friendly, costly, and
               time-consuming protocols. In this regard, we propose, for the
               first time, a sub-minute (around 50 s) and reagentless surface
               treatment of carbon-black/PLA-based 3D-printed electrodes using a
               Photo-Thermal approach by a CO2 laser. After the proposed
               treatment (optimized conditions: the power of 6.2\%, the scan
               rate of 20 mm s−1, and height of 10 mm), a marked improvement in
               the electrochemical electrode response (current increase and
               peak-to-peak separation) was achieved towards the detection of
               catechol, ascorbic and uric acids, paracetamol,
               hexaammineruthenium(III) chloride, and Ferri/ferrocyanide redox
               couple. The enhanced simultaneous determination of Cd2+, Pb2+,
               and Cu2+ was also demonstrated. As a proof-of-concept, the
               quantification of the adulterant paracetamol in a real seized
               cocaine sample was performed using a fully 3D-printed
               electrochemical system, and a good recovery value of 97.8\% was
               acquired. To explain all the improved results, the electrode was
               carefully characterized by imaging, spectroscopic and
               electrochemical techniques. Additionally, the between-measurement
               \% relative standard deviation (\%RSD) was 6.8\% (n = 12), while
               the between-device \%RSD was 7.5\% (n = 6) at the 1 µmol L-1
               paracetamol, indicating adequate manufacturing reproducibility.
               Thus, the strategies developed here open up new possibilities for

               fundamental implementation limitations. An alternative is to use

               is embodied in our sbt-rats plugin for the Scala Build Tool. At
               its simplest, sbt-rats provides a bridge to the Rats! parser
               generator for Java. On top of this bridge, we have a simple

               and lignin) has attracted increasing attention by using this
               abundant, sustainable, and ecofriendly material. While cellulose
               can be easily tailored into a highly viscous ink for 3D printing,
               after solvent evaporation, the final printed structures become
               highly porous, fragile, and easily fall apart in water due to its
               hydrophilic nature. Lignin, another crucial component of natural
               lignocellulose, has not yet been reported for ink printing due to
               its unfavorable rheological behavior. Herein, a low-cost direct
               ink printing strategy is developed to fabricate lignin-based 3D
               structures with lignin no further refined and a more compact
               microstructure as well as different functionalities compared with
               printed cellulose. By using a soft triblock copolymer as the
               crosslinking agent, the rheology of lignin-based inks can be
               adjusted from soft to rigid, and even enables vertical printing
               which requires stiff and self-supporting features. The
               lignin-based inks contain less water (≈40 wt\%) and exhibit a
               much denser, stiffer structure, resulting in a wet tensile
               strength of ≈30 MPa, compared to only ≈0.6 MPa for printed
               cellulose. In addition, the unique macromolecular structure of
               lignin also demonstrates significantly improved stability in
               water and under heat, as well as UV-blocking performance. © 2020

               improvements compared to existing technologies, enabling more

               illustrate the authors' position, a case from the construction
               sector is presented, for which the feasibility and impact of 3D
               printing technology has been studied. The empirical study focuses
               on the effect of the use of 3D printing technology on the
               building supply chain, aimed primarily at manufacturing companies
               in construction, but including suppliers, architects and
               designers as well. Findings - 3D printing of concrete potentially
               provides several improvements in manufacturing performance, such
               as a shortening of lead times, integration of functions and
               allowing for reduced material usage, therefore possibly turning

               analysis of flatness, straightness and dimensions deviations was
               carried out with high-precision measurement systems, and
               according to current standards regarding linear dimensions and

               characteristics, and analysis of variance and response surface
               design methods were used for the data analysis. The printing
               experiment was carried out for each color. After that, the
               measurement of the printed parts and the study of the data were
               performed. The first finding is that for black and clear
               eco-resin, there are problems with the printing of the supports.
               Based on standard data for the range of nominal lengths of the

               packing density, rheological properties, and printability of the
               composites were synergistically investigated. Moreover, the ratio
               of the sand-to-binder (S/B) was also analyzed to explore the
               performance response. Results show that when composites contain
               33.33 wt\% calcined clay, 16.67 wt\% limestone powder and 5 wt\%
               SF with S/B ratio of 2.5, the dynamic yield stress, static yield
               stress, and structural recovery can be significantly improved.
               The proposed mortar can be continuously extruded with few defects
               and exhibited an excellent shape retention during printing
               process. Furthermore, the embodied energy (EE) and embodied
               carbon emissions (ECO2e) per cubic meter of optimal mortar
               respectively decreased by 50.2\% and 45.2\% with respect to the

               together with optimum particle packing system mutually
               contributed to lower the cement content of composites that

               last decade. It shows great potential in reducing the need for
               energy- and resource-intensive manufacturing processes, which in
               turn reduces the amount of material required in the supply chain,
               and enables more environmentally benign practices. However, the
               question of how to realize these potential benefits has received
               little attention. This paper aims to provide an overview of the
               Sustainability of Additive Manufacturing (SAM). The context of
               the SAM is introduced, with a focus on energy and environmental
               impacts. Resource consumption is identified as the most important
               aspect. Examination from a life cycle perspective is also
               presented, with explicit discussions on opportunities to reduce
               energy and material consumption through design, material
               preparation, manufacturing, usage, and end-of-life treatment.
               Statistical data analysis provides an overview of impact
               forecasts, highlighting the importance of and need for thorough
               research on sustainability. The eco-design concept enabled by AM
               is identified as the most promising and effective technology,

               conclusions. General models for each type of AM process are still

               improve systematic data integration and management, correlate
               energy and quality, develop intelligent machinery, focus on
               material preparation and recycling, and discover innovative

              mode; processing of whole rendered page bitmap requires
              significant computational costs. We propose to add small holes of

              based on processing pipeline in RIP of standard printer languages

              toner saving for typical office documents up to 15-20\%. Rate of

               However, the relatively restricted range of 3D printable
               biocomposites decelerated its adoption in the biomedical sector
               as a conventional manufacturing technique. In this method, the
               introduction of biofillers with unique properties to produce high
               performance composites as printing feedstocks are increasingly
               recommended. The interest in using eco-friendly fillers from
               waste as reinforcing agents for producing lightweight and
               low-cost poly(lactic acid) (PLA) composites is recently
               increased. In this work, a series of PLA biocomposites filled
               with calcined seashell (CSh) particles have been prepared by melt
               mixing technique using a twin-screw extruder, and characterized
               by different morphological, thermal, and mechanical methods. The
               visco-elastic parameters have been determined for these

               morphological analysis revealed a homogenous dispersion of CSh
               fillers within the biopolymeric matrix, which was responsible for
               the enhancement of the various mechanical properties. Where, by
               adding 10 wt\% of treated CSh, the tensile modulus and strength
               were significantly increased from 183.8 ± 4.7 MPa and 29.81 ± 1.8
               MPa to 241.9 ± 63 MPa and 49.06 ± 8.87 MPa, respectively,
               compared to the virgin PLA. In addition, respected to PLA matrix,
               the compressive moduli of the printed specimens of PLA/5CSh and
               PLA/10CSh biocomposite filaments exhibited improvements of 5\%
               and 14\%, respectively. Moreover, the thermal analysis showed a
               marked improvement in the thermal stability of the elaborated
               biocomposites, where the degradation temperature (Td50) have been
               upgraded by 4°C for the biocomposite containing 10 wt\% of CSh

               In the present paper, a form finding for a cement based
               tessellated pierced vault is studied. The multi-body rope
               approach (MRA) was used to define compression-only vault optimal
               shapes. Successively, the thrust network analysis (TNA) was
               implemented by Rhino-vault for a further validation of the shape
               and the definition of different tessellation meshes of the
               surfaces, according to different hole pattern configuration.
               Different piercing percentage of the vaults were considered and
               compared for the best solution identification. In addition, the
               geometrical solutions were analyzed by means of global stability
               analysis, taking into account the different positions of the
               holes. Furthermore, 3D printing with a Fuse Deposition Modeling
               (FDM) technique in polylactide (PLA) material (completely
               eco-friendly) is used for the construction of the formworks of

               by a certain piercing percentage was subjected to different
               loading conditions and monitored by a non-contact device based on
               the Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique. The 3D-DIC was
               performed to recognize the structural behavior during the loading
               process of the model (prototype). DIC measurements were used to
               recognize in advance the critical condition of the vault under
               loading and the displacement measurements were correlated to the

               1980's and is still developing in a way that can be used for
               customized products with complex design and miniature features.
               Among all the available 3D printing techniques, Fused Deposition
               Modeling (FDM) is one of the most widely used technologies
               because of its capability to build different structures by
               employing various materials. However, complexity of parts made by
               FDM is greatly limited by restriction of using support materials.
               Support materials are often used in FDM for several complex
               geometries such as fully suspended shapes, overhanging surfaces
               and hollow features. This paper describes an approach to 3D print
               a structure using silicone elastomer and polylactide fiber (PLA)
               by employing a novel support material that is soluble in water.
               This support material is melted sugar which can easily be
               prepared at a low cost. Sugar is a carbohydrate, which is found
               naturally in plants such as sugarcane and sugar beets; therefore,
               it is completely organic and eco-friendly. As another advantage,
               the time for removing this material from the part is considerably
               less than other commercially available support materials and it
               can be removed easily by warm water without leaving any trace.
               Experiments were done using an inexpensive desktop 3D printer to
               fabricate complex structures for use in soft robots. The results
               envision that further development of this system would contribute
               to a method of fabrication of complex parts with lower cost yet

               applications by using an eco-friendly and sustainable approach.
               Engineering nano hydroxyapatite (EnHA) was derived from chicken

               industrially relevant electrocatalytic materials and devices. In
               this perspective, we define the scope of benefit of 3D printing,
               its potential, limitations, and current trends of development for
               electrocatalytic applications. We analyze future prospective
               electrodes in terms of size, printing resolution, and cost. We
               examine the strategies employed in post-processing of 3D-printed
               electrodes and in the fabrication of electrocatalytically based
               prototyping devices. We also offer our perspective on how rapid

               electrocatalytic interfaces and the electrocatalysis field in
               general. © 2019 Elsevier Inc. The application of advanced
               manufacturing techniques such as additive manufacturing, or 3D

               an attractive, eco-friendly route to rapidly evolve production
               designs without the need to retool a manufacturing facility. This

               development as well as facilitating fabrication of novel
               structures for fundamental studies in electrocatalytic
               applications. Unlike the direct impact of 3D printing in some
               other applications, the highly interdisciplinary and complex
               nature of materials, chemistry, and catalytic interfaces along
               with the scale required for electrocatalysis (and low demand for

               concept of sustainable manufacturing has emerged to address this
               scarcity and to minimise environmental degradation. 3D printing
               also known as additive manufacturing, could potentially reduce
               material wastage, energy consumption and resulting emissions. A
               'techno-eco-efficiency' framework was developed to produce
               technically, economically, and environmentally feasible
               centrifugal pump impellers 3D printed using the fused filament
               fabrication process. Firstly, surface properties, geometric
               properties, build material properties, static structural and
               dynamic properties, and the hydraulic performance of impellers
               were assessed in order to investigate how process parameters,
               such as infill pattern, infill rate and reinforcement material
               affect the technical performance. Secondly, the eco-efficiency
               performance of technically suitable impellers was assessed using
               environmental life cycle assessment, life cycle costing tools and
               portfolio analysis. Thus, this 'techno-eco-efficiency' framework
               was used to achieve sustainable manufacturing and could act as a
               decision support tool for selecting cost-competitive,
               environmentally benign, and technically feasible products.
               Alternatively, it would assist product designers and
               manufacturers to minimise a trade-off between technical and
               resulting eco-efficiency performance. Copyright © 2021

               revolutionize the construction sector and is often presented as a
               means to reduce its environmental footprint. However, at least in
               the case of concrete, it encounters significant challenges in
               terms of material design, since high paste volumes and Portland
               cement contents are normally used due to process requirements. In
               this article, the application to layered extrusion of a recently
               developed low clinker cement containing 50\% Portland cement and
               50\% supplementary cementitious materials, such as limestone,
               burnt oil shale, and fly ash, is presented. It is found that an
               accelerator paste composed by Calcium Aluminate Cement (CAC) and

               high-priced green and greenwashed products will be perceived high
               in monetary sacrifice.H1b: When consumers’ motivation to process
               information is low, in comparison to a green product, the high
               price of a greenwashed product will be perceived high in monetary
               sacrifice.H2: Perceptions of ethicality will mediate the

               (greenwashed) or six (green) eco-friendly attributes and a
               fictitious brand name (Envyo) with a price of \$399.99. We
               measured perceived monetary sacrifice, willingness to purchase

               hypothesis-inconsistent categories. Study 2b In this study, we
               measured ethicality concerns explicitly to test for mediation.
               Fifty-nine participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk were randomly
               assigned to one of the two conditions in a single-factor
               (greenness, green vs. greenwashed) between-subjects design. We
               used the vignettes from Study 1 to manipulate greenness and to
               create a low motivation to process information. Results from
               mediation analysis indicate that greenness significantly
               predicted ethicality (β = 1.41; 95\% CI = 0.63 to 2.20), and
               ethicality significantly predicted perceived sacrifice (β =
               −0.23; 95\% CI = −0.45 to −0.02). As expected, ethicality
               mediated the relationship between level of greenness and
               perceptions of sacrifice (indirect effect = −0.33; 95\% CI =
               −0.76 to −0.03). © 2018, Academy of Marketing Science.",

               biomass selective laser sintering (SLS) parts is limited and
               low-quality. This study aims to demonstrate the effects of the
               various processing parameters on the dimensional accuracy,
               bending strength, tensile strength, density and impact strength
               of the Prosopis chilensis/polyethersulfone (PES) composites
               (PCPCs) that were produced by SLS. The various processing
               parameters are laser power, scan speed, preheating temperature,
               scan spacing and layer thickness. In addition, the authors’
               studied the effects of PCP particle size on the mechanical
               properties of the PCPCs. Design/methodology/approach: The PCPC
               specimens were printed using an AFS SLS machine (additive
               manufacturing). The bending, tensile and impact strengths of the
               specimens were measured using a universal tensile tester. The
               dimensional accuracy of the bending specimens was determined by a
               Vernier caliper. The formability of the PCPC at various mixing
               ratios of the raw materials was earlier investigated by
               single-layer sintering experiments (Idriss et al., 2020b). The
               microstructure and particle distribution of the various PCPC
               specimens were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
               Findings: The mechanical strengths (bending, tensile and impact
               strengths and density) and the dimensional accuracy of the PCPC
               SLS parts were directly and inversely proportional, respectively,
               to the laser power and preheating temperature. Furthermore, the
               mechanical strengths and dimensional accuracy of the PCPC SLS
               parts were inversely and directly proportional, respectively, to
               the scanning speed, scan spacing and layer thickness. Practical
               implications: PCPC is an inexpensive, energy-efficient material
               that can address the drawbacks of the existing SLS parts. It is
               also eco-friendly because it lowers the pollution and CO2
               emissions that are associated with waste disposal and SLS,
               respectively. The optimization of the processing parameters of
               SLS in this study produced high-quality PCPC parts with high
               mechanical strengths and dimensional accuracy that could be used
               for the manufacture of the roof and wooden floors, construction
               components and furniture manufacturing. Originality/value: To the
               best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is among the first to
               elucidate the impact of the various SLS processing parameters on
               the mechanical properties and dimensional accuracy of the
               sintered parts. Furthermore, novel PCPC parts were produced in
               this study by SLS. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

               have extracted it from the Salento quarries for use as an
               ornamental, celebrative or building material. The production
               chain of this stone, from extraction through to the finished
               product, results in a great deal of scraps produced in both solid
               and muddy form. In recent decades a new attitude toward stone
               scraps has gradually taken hold, namely an eco-design approach.
               Already adopted by some companies, it consists of reusing
               industrial scraps to produce innovative manufacturing products.
               Nowadays, in fact, only a small percentage of Lecce Stone (LS)
               scraps is recycled and used as raw material in other fields,
               while a significant portion is taken to the landfill, as in the

               consumption, and improve workmanship. The 3D-printed concrete
               technology (3DPCT), more broadly recognized as the design of a 3D
               object via a computer-aided design (CAD) model or a digital 3D
               model, has accelerated considerable progress in these areas in
               other industries. Although 3DPCT has advanced remarkably in
               recent years, producing an appropriate 3D printing material that
               improves performance while reducing material consumption, which
               is really important for CO2 reduction, is urgently needed. The
               present 3DPCT faces many obstacles, one of which is the limited
               range of printable concretes. To tackle this limitation,
               extensive studies on developing creative approaches for
               formulating alkali-activated materials (AAMs) for 3DPCT for
               modern building applications have been conducted. AAMs are
               maintainable substitutive binders to ordinary Portland cement.
               Therefore, the need to undertake a comprehensive literature
               review on the current status of AAM performance on 3D-printable
               concretes for building applications is substantial. This article
               comprehensively reviews the quality requirements, advantages,
               disadvantages, common techniques, delivery, and placement of
               3DCP. This literature also delivers indepth reviews on the
               behaviors and the properties of AAM-based concrete composites
               used in 3D-printed construction. Moreover, research trends are
               moving toward a wide-ranging understanding concerning the
               economic benefits and the environmental footprints of 3DCP for
               building applications with AAMs as suitable concrete materials
               for the emerging robust eco-friendly concrete composite for
               digital construction constructions nowadays. Given the merits of
               the study, several hotspot research topics for future

               In the automotive industry, one of the ways to achieve that is a
               reduction of the support structure weight. The solution that was
               derived from aerospace industry is monocoque support structure.
               Nevertheless, proper design of such structure is challenging,
               expensive, especially in unit production and hard to repair or
               modify in case of new subassemblies. An alternative solution for
               vehicle lightweight support structure is spatial frame created
               from carbon fibre reinforced composite tubes. A problem of such
               structure, in case of laminate composite materials, are the tubes
               connections. In classical aluminium spatial frame connections are
               welded, and therefore their strength is close to the material
               strength. In case of carbon fibre, such connections are usually
               created using adhesives, connecting carbon fibre reinforced tubes
               with composite shaped connectors or by precise cutting of the
               ends of tubes in order to increase area of contact between
               interfaces, applying adhesive and bounding tubes using composite
               materials. Another considered solution is carbon fibre tubes
               reinforced with 3D printed ribbing. Both analysis and
               optimization were conducted using HyperWorks software. The paper

  abstract = "Plastic cards are widely used in various industries all over the
              world. Many on-demand non-embossed pictured cards require
              overcoating (also referred to as laminating) processes for surface
              protection from fading, abrasion, alteration and counterfeiting.
              There are several lamination types, such as wet lamination, dry
              lamination, hot-melt lamination and extrusion lamination. The
              focus on this paper is the hot-melt lamination type which utilizes
              heat and pressure to adhere the film on the card. The laminating /
              overcoating layer material can be clear material with
              anti-abrasion capability or hologram material for authentication.
              Typical overcoating process in the thermal transfer card printer
              is done by thermal printhead or heat roller. This paper suggests
              the heating head for this process. The heating head works on a
              very similar principle as the thermal printhead. The heating
              resistive element and temperature sensing element are placed on
              the alumina head substrate. When power is applied, the resistive
              element generates heat for the overcoating material to thermally
              adhere to the plastic card surface. Unlike the thermal printhead,
              however, which has hundreds of tiny heating elements, the heating
              head has one contiguous heating element. The construction of the
              heating head gives more robust thermal performance and even
              heating capability across the overcoating material on the card
              surface. In comparison to a heat roller, the heating head can be
              used on-demand and does not require the constant pre-heating while
              the unit is on stand-by (more ``eco-friendly'' efficiency and
              safety). ©2012 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",

              of settlements and health. It gives a brief introduction to the
              issues before summarising the evidence in relation to a range of
              topics, concluding with some more speculative thoughts on likely
              future findings. Modern planning was invented in response to
              inhumane living conditions in 19th century cities. But in the last
              century the connection was lost. Only now, with concerns over
              climate change and obesity, is there beginning to be the
              realisation that the physical environment is an important
              determinant of health. The paper uses a particular model of this
              relationship based on eco-system and health determinants theories
              to structure the review of evidence. The review covers: lifestyle
              choices in relation to physical activity and diet, mental
              well-being and community, the local economy and income, health
              inequalities and strategic land use transport planning, pollution
              and urban form, and finally impacts on global ecology. There is
              now a growing consensus that while personal factors are critical
              in determining health, the urban environment exacerbates or
              mitigates health and well-being outcomes. The level of active
              travel (walking and cycling) and outdoor recreational activity is
              strongly affected by accessibility to local facilities. Access to
              green, natural environments, and to local social networks, are
              factors in mental well-being. The wider sub-regional pattern of
              housing, economic development, land use and transport is a
              determinant of social exclusion and therefore health inequalities.
              It also affects health-damaging pollution, adaptability in the
              face of climate change and the level of carbon dioxide emissions.
              We have literally been building unhealthy conditions into many of
              our towns and cities. But comparisons with the best cities in
              Europe indicate that it is possible to reverse the less desirable
              trends. Success depends, however, on more radical policies of
              local authority control over land and finance than any political
              party has yet advocated. It also requires collaboration between
              the full range of powerful public and private organizations that
              influence the built environment. Future research is likely to
              further strengthen these conclusions. It will become much more
              obvious that planning for health and well-being is not only the
              NHS, but about creating a health-promoting physical, social and
              economic environment. © 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of

               experts in this growing field. Part I of this book, with three
               chapters, was devoted to strategic decisions facing firms
               regarding the secondary market for its products: whether to
               pursue remanufacturing, leasing versus selling, the impact of
               take-back legislation, and guidelines for product design for
               CLSCs. Part II, with four chapters, was devoted to more tactical
               issues, once the decision to “close the loop” has been made.
               Issues explored include network design (for collection,
               consolidation, and reprocessing centers), used-product
               acquisition, grading and disposition, production planning for
               remanufactured products, and marketing issues for remanufactured
               products-pricing, positioning, and warranties. Part III was
               devoted to case studies: one chapter was devoted to the motion
               picture industry, one chapter to eco-efficiency initiatives in
               hospitals, and one chapter to the discussion of practices in
               retreaded tires, computers and printers, printer cartridges, and

               summarizing empirical findings, and another chapter summarizing
               case studies presented at a recent workshop, as well as how CLSC

  abstract  = "Additive manufacturing (AM) has been considered as a promising
               technology with higher resource efficiency and better ecological
               benefits in production systems. However, recent works have shown
               that the ecological benefits of AM are sensitive to the
               parameters in operation. If the parameters are not designed
               appropriately, the ecological performance of AM can be worse than
               conventional manufacturing processes. To ensure the ecological
               benefits of AM, eco-design based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
               is a promising approach to analyze and minimize the environmental
               impacts of AM. However, LCA can only be carried out at the later
               stage of the design process after most design and decision
               operations are already made because the implementation of LCA
               requires detailed process and inventory information of the entire
               life cycle. If users attempt to optimize the ecological
               performance of their design solutions, they need to repeat almost
               the entire design process. To solve this problem, this work
               suggests using energy performance assessment to replace LCA in
               eco-design for AM. The proposed approach uses a holistic
               framework consisting of three parts: a simulation tool for energy
               consumption prediction of AM, an assessment model for energy
               performance of AM, and general workflows of eco-design for AM.
               Since the energy performance quantification and assessment of AM
               require less process information, it can be integrated earlier
               and easier into the eco-design for AM. Additionally, an example
               of use case is provided that confirms the feasibility of this
               framework. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

               behavior and the effect of exchanging the loading site on
               physicochemical properties of the resulting fibers were studied.
               The printed fibrous membranes possess a biphasic drug release
               profile in simulated intestinal fluid with a burst release within
               the first 12 h and a slower sustained release up to 72 h. The

               healthcare professionals is essential. 3D printing technology
               could represent a valid option to ameliorate PPE shortages.
               Methodology: Custom-made face mask were designed on the basis of
               facial scan and then 3D-printed. The whole protocol is executed
               with freeware software and only required a 3D printer. Six
               healthcare workers wore the device weekly thus expressing a
               judgment regarding quality of work, respiratory and skin comfort.
               Results: The estimated total cost of a single mask is
               approximately 5 USD. The virtual design of a complete mask lasted
               68 minutes on average. Most healthcare workers rated comfort as

               provide clear evidence of the agglomeration of CO2 snow inside a

               providing highly opportunity to advance performance of CO2
               cleaning. To prolonging the research results of agglomeration

               controlling-technologies of snow particles, include the onset

               investigates the agglomeration mechanism of CO2 primary particles
               inside a tube. Results show that a complicated particle motion in
               the upper portion of the tube is responsible for the formation of
               large snow. A minimum tube length of 30mm, onset condition, is
               needed to ensure the complete formation of agglomerated
               mechanisms with recirculation flow, and thus ensure the formation
               of considerable agglomerated particles. Results also show that
               the onset condition of agglomeration is influenced by the flow
               condition, as well as the lucking of the main flow. © 2015

               for which many new processes and materials are currently being
               developed. The biggest advantage is that almost any shape can be
               produced, while conventional manufacturing methods reach their
               limits. Furthermore, a lot of material is saved because the part
               is created in layers and only as much material is used as
               necessary. In contrast, in the case of machining processes, it is
               not uncommon for more than half of the material to be removed and
               disposed of. Recently, new additive manufacturing processes have
               been on the market that enables the manufacturing of components
               using the FDM process with fiber reinforcement. This opens up new
               possibilities for optimizing components in terms of their
               strength and at the same time increasing sustainability by
               reducing materials consumption and waste. Within the scope of
               this work, different types of test specimens are to be designed,
               manufactured and examined. The test specimens are tensile
               specimens, which are used both for standardized tensile tests and
               for examining a practical component from automotive engineering
               used in student project. This project is a vehicle designed to
               compete in the Shell Eco-marathon, one of the world’s largest
               energy efficiency competitions. The aim is to design a vehicle
               that covers a certain distance with as little fuel as possible.
               Accordingly, it is desirable to manufacture the components with
               the lowest possible weight, while still ensuring the required
               rigidity. To achieve this, the use of fiber-reinforced 3D-printed
               parts is particularly suitable due to the high rigidity. In
               particular, the joining technology for connecting conventionally
               and additively manufactured components is developed. As a result,
               the economic efficiency was assessed, and guidelines for the
               design of components and joining elements were created. In
               addition, it could be shown that the additive manufacturing of
               the component could be implemented faster and more sustainably
               than the previous conventional manufacturing. © The Editor(s) (if

               of metals is the high geometric flexibility of the processes and
               its ability to produce pilot or small batch series. In contrast,
               resource and energy intensities are often not considered as
               constraints, even though the turnout of additive manufacturing is
               high, at least compared to chip removing processes. The study at
               hand analyses the material characteristics and environmental
               impacts of a hose nozzle as an example of a commercial product of
               simple geometry. The production routes turning (conventional
               manufacturing) and laser beam melting (additive manufacturing)
               are compared to each other in terms of natural resource use,
               climate change potential and primary energy demand. It is found,
               that the product shows a lower demand for natural resources when
               produced via AM, but higher carbon emissions and energy demand
               when using a steel, that is mainly (80\%) produced from
               high-alloyed steel scrap. However, different case studies during
               the sensitivity analyses showed that a number of factors highly
               influence the results: the steel source as well as the source of
               electricity play a major role in determining the environmental
               performance of the production routes. The authors also found that
               other production processes (here cold forging of tubes) might be
               an eco-friendly alternative to both routes, if feasible from an
               economic point of view. In regard to the material
               characteristics, experimental testing revealed that the material
               advantages of AM produced hose nozzles (in particular higher
               yield strength) are reduced after a solution heat treatment is
               applied to the as-produced material, in order to increase
               corrosion resistance. However, products that do not require this
               production step might benefit from the higher yield strength, as
               a lower wall thickness could be realised. © 2019",

               manufactured part in service. This paper deals with three aspects
               of sustainability as it applies to additive manufacturing. First
               is a review of the research needs for energy and sustainability
               as applied to additive manufacturing based on the 2009 Roadmap
               for Additive Manufacturing Workshop. The second part is an energy
               assessment for selective laser sintering (SLS) of polymers. Using
               polyamide powder in a 3D Systems Vanguard HiQ Sinterstation,
               energy loss during a build was measured due to the chamber
               heaters, the roller mechanism, the piston elevators and the
               laser. This accounted for 95\% of the total energy consumption.
               An overall energy assessment was accomplished using
               eco-indicators. The last topic is electrochemical deposition of
               porous SLS non-polymeric preforms. The goal is to reduce energy
               consumption in SLS of non-polymeric materials. The approach was
               to mix a transient binder with the material, to create an SLS
               green part, to convert the binder, and then to remove the open,
               connected porosity and to densify the part by chemical deposition

               measured at 2.55 with a loss tangent of 0.053. A conductor is

              and it was more eco-friendly than other printing inks. In
              addition, the wide-format printing could be used on building
              material and home decorations. Due to its wide range of
              applications, UV wide-format inkjet printing possessed great
              marketing value in the future. The objectives of the project are
              as follows: 1.Establishing general quality attributes for UV
              wide-format inkjet printing in Taiwan, and 2. Determine the market
              potential for UV Wide format inkjet printing in Taiwan among the
              printing industry and their procurement intentions. This research
              is conducted in two phases, with the first stage involving a
              quantitative experimental study, by printing samples, with three
              kinds of printing substrates (glass, acrylic and melamine plywood)
              using five brands' UV wide format inkjet printer, to establish a
              quantitative measurement techniques and attributes for better
              quality of printing. The second stage relies on research methods,
              we would invite experts of printing industry and scholarship, and
              interview them concerning reasons for different aspects of UV
              wide-format inkjet printing. The content of the interview would be
              closely examined in order to clarify the ideas generated by them.
              From the result of the experiment, the data of how UV wide-format
              inkjet printers from five different brands adapted to three
              different printing materials could be obtained. The qualities of
              various materials could also be observed, and thus a proper
              specification of UV printers could be established. Moreover,
              through expert surveys, the study could also provide investors
              with the future trend of UV wide-format printing in both Taiwan
              and international market, which could help them examine whether
              the firm meets their requirement.",

               process, there are many positive environmental advantages of
               additive manufacturing technologies. Most importantly, there is
               less waste of raw material and the use of new and smart
               materials. It appears to concentrate on the output of a component
               on lesser material waste, energy usage, and machine emissions.
               There is a need to study the environmental sustainability of
               additive manufacturing technologies and their applications. As
               more businesses aim to strengthen their eco-footprint,
               sustainability in AM is gaining momentum. Visionary leaders of
               the industry are continually challenging their employees to find
               new ways to reduce waste, improving their workforce's
               manufacturing environment, and find innovative ways to use new

               merely swabbing the surface. We obtained the detection limit

               should be re-cycle, re-used, reduced or even eliminated, if
               possible. A giant amount of waste, such as:
               electronics/electrical items, manufacturing scrap, discarded
               constructional materials, polymers from daily needs, etc., is
               being generated day-by-day, whereas its treatment is lagging. The
               term zero waste (ZW) is continuously encouraging both producers
               and consumers to adopt sustainable approaches in order to reduce
               their expenditures as well as to help in making a better world.
               In the past, researchers have highlighted numerous techniques to
               tackle physical waste, however the chemicals which are normally
               generated from this waste is more critical and limitedly

               for future of manufacturing by which the burning issue of “Waste”
               can be tackled. However, ZWM can be supported with recycling and
               reusability of the produced wastes in another manufacturing

               An artificial reef (AR) could be a tool for protecting or
               restoring these habitats and their declining biodiversity, and
               also help to enhance sustainable fisheries. The goal is to design
               non-polluting structures that best mimic the complexity of
               natural habitats in order to improve their service to the
               community. To date, the assessment of reef performance has been
               mostly focused on fish assemblages and species of ecological
               and/or socio-economic interest, and has disregarded the biofilm
               communities that determine the first level of an AR's trophic
               network. In this work, we used biofilm formation to compare the
               quality of substrates used as building parts for an AR, in order
               to optimize an eco-friendly material that will be used to design
               a new generation of ARs produced by giant 3D printers. The
               structure of the photosynthetic communities has been identified
               using pigment biomarkers and their production of exudates has
               been analysed. These polymeric substances were quantified in
               terms of total sugar and protein concentrations. They were
               further analysed in terms of amino acid content. We found no
               significant differences between the micro-algae communities
               developed on the different substrates. These photosynthetic
               communities were mainly composed of diatoms, prasinophytes,
               haptophytes, and dinoflagellates. However, we showed that the
               material for ARs is crucial for biofilm development, especially
               with regard to its secretions of sugar. The choice of an
               appropriate substrate for AR construction is thus of particular
               importance since biofilm secretions determine the organic
               substrate on which sessile macro-organisms will settle. © 2018

               (POP) display catches eye with strong wording and colorful
               branding. Vinyl, film, and fabric service customers with a range

               protecting digital output from abrasion, providing greater
               longevity, and aiding installation. Most media used for POP
               display are not paper-based substrates. The key to achieving the
               best quality color reproduction of POP display media is to
               combine the right equipment, software, and media. To examine the
               color reproduction capability of POP display media, sets of
               printed samples were prepared. Five commercially available
               display media (eco-friendly and traditional) were used. It was
               found that, the print combination of HP Designjet Z2100 printer
               with glossy paper setting produced largest color gamut with
               tested display media. However, the Epson Stylus Pro 4800 printer
               with matte paper setting was most capable of producing consistent
               color gamut for display media such as DuPont Tyvek,
               Polypripylene, and Satin Cloth. For the Eco-friendly display
               media, the highest gamut volume can be achieved when using HP
               Designjet Z2100 printer with glossy paper setting and DuPont
               Tyvek display media. For the Vinyl display media, the highest
               gamut volume can be achieved when using HP Designjet Z2100
               printer with glossy paper setting and Aqual Vinyl display media.",

               on mechanical and thermal properties of
               Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)/Poly(lactic acid)/Plasticizer
               biodegradable blends. These plasticizers were first tested with
               respect to their miscibility with
               Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)/Poly(lactic acid) (PHB/PLA) blends using
               a kneading machine. PHB/PLA/plasticizer blends in the weight
               ratio (wt \%) of 60/25/15 were then prepared by single screw and
               corotating meshing twin screw extruders in the form of filament
               for further three-dimensional (3D) printing. Mechanical, thermal
               properties, and shape stability (warping effect) of 3D printed
               products can be improved just by the addition of appropriate
               plasticizer to polymeric blend. The goal was to create new types
               of eco-friendly PHB/PLA/plasticizers blends and to highly improve
               the poor mechanical properties of neat PHB/PLA blends (with
               majority of PHB) by adding appropriate plasticizer. Mechanical
               properties of plasticized blends were then determined by the
               tensile test of 3D printed test samples (dogbones), as well as
               filaments. Measured elongation at break rapidly enhanced from
               21\% for neat non-plasticized PHB/PLA blends (reference) to 328\%
               for best plasticized blends in the form of filament, and from 5\%
               (reference) to 187\% for plasticized blends in the form of
               printed dogbones. The plasticizing effect on blends was confirmed
               by Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The study of
               morphology was performed by the Scanning Electron Microscopy.
               Significant problem of plasticized blends used to be also
               plasticizer migration, therefore the diffusion of plasticizers
               from the blends after 15 days of exposition to 110 °C in the
               drying oven was investigated as their measured weight loss.
               Almost all of the used plasticizers showed meaningful positive
               softening effects, but the diffusion of plasticizers at 110 °C
               exposition was quite extensive. The determination of the degree
               of disintegration of selected plasticized blend when exposed to a
               laboratory-scale composting environment was executed to roughly
               check the ``biodegradability''. © 2018 by the authors.",
