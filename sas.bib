              as it establishes a global mitigation framework towards 2030 and
              sets the ground for a potential 1.5 °C climate stabilization. To
              provide useful insights for the 2018 UNFCCC Talanoa facilitative
              dialogue, we use eight state-of-the-art climate-energy-economy
              models to assess the effectiveness of the Intended Nationally
              Determined Contributions (INDCs) in meeting high probability 1.5
              and 2 °C stabilization goals. We estimate that the implementation
              of conditional INDCs in 2030 leaves an emissions gap from least

              immediate transition to a more efficient and low-carbon energy
