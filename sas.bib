  abstract = "The Leontief inverse is a very useful and powerful tool in
              input-output analysis. It features in the computation of various
              kind of multipliers such income and employment multiplier and
              play an important role in economic impact studies, analysis of
              structural change and identification of key sectors for
              development planning. For policy and planning purposes, direct
              projection of the Leontief inverse become desirable and the RAS
              method is proposed as a means to do that. This method has some
              advantages over the conventional method of updating the technical
              coefficient matrix in order to derive the Leontief inverse.
              Firstly, it deals with a matrix which more ``dense'' and hence
              rounding errors in computation of the R's and S's are reduced.
              Secondly, the technical coefficient matrix derived from the
              projected Leontief inverse has a functional form which is more
              general than the bi-proportional representation. Furthermore,
              this approach does not require more information than the
              conventional RAS used to project the technical coefficient
              matrix.",
