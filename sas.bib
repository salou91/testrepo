              with his press operators regarding raw material usage. He should
              take time to review the proofing systems he has in place. The

              green IT started to find its way onto the green enterprise agenda;
              IT professionals can allow themselves a plaudit or two for showing
              leadership here, because it is through the 'greening' of the IT
              function that most organisational carbon management programmes
              entered corporate consciousness. At a time when the remit of the
              IT function itself was being undermined by executive forces
              alleging that IT was neither flexible nor amenable to the needs of
              'the business', the environmentalist debate gave IT heads a
              platform to re-assert their status in the management hierarchy. It
              also restored some of the political clout IT formerly enjoyed: it
              was re-empowered to drive through changes.The economy is looking
              healthier now, and the green IT 'agenda' has moved on since 2005.
              The CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme legislation has introduced a
              legal motivation for organisations to review their energy usage
              and take steps to implement policies and procedures that make
              carbon control intrinsic to the articles of their governance.
              However, as the recent Green Enterprise World Forum showed, the IT
              industry has passed beyond the awareness phase and must now
              concentrate its talents on shaping the the future green IT.The
              pursuit of green IT is perforce subject also to changes in working
              practices. The gradual but steady trend toward the so-called
              mobile enterprise is going to have important repercussions on the
              way IT is provisioned to business users and on the way it consumes
              energy. With mobile devices enabling large percentages of the
              workforce to work away from an office base, the requirement to
              provision multiple desktops (or docking stations), each with a
              network connection and power source, will become less crucial; and

  abstract = "When designing a print product, recyclability used to have little
              priority. In the last years it has become more important. Among
              other factors, the printing process itself is crucial for the
              re-use of a printed product - flexo, UV, inkjet, liquid toners as
              well as some adhesives can be challenges for the production of
              recycled graphic paper. With rising environmental awareness, paper
              recycling becomes a more and more important issue also in
              marketing of printers and - accordingly - in the development of a
              printer. But very little is known about coherences. During the
              recycling process, the ink is separated from the paper fibers
              dissolved in water, and then it has to be removed from the aqueous
              suspension. This is why current inkjet inks are almost impossible
              to deink. Field testing of the deinkability has been done for the
              last decade but without any rating system to evaluate a certain
              printed product. The European Recovered Paper Council (ERPC)
              adopted a Scoring System for Deinkability in 2008. This system is
              based on the evaluation of the deinkability according to INGEDE
              Method 11, a lab procedure that has been developed to evaluate and
              compare the challenge a printed product means for a paper
              recycling mill. In 2009, INGEDE began to establish a certificate
              confirming the deinkability of a printed product, serving frequent
              requests of both authorities and printing as well as printer
              industry. The certificate has already been accepted by the
              Austrian Consumer Organization VKI who was the first to include
              deinkability into the criteria for their eco-label for printed
              products. The underlying procedure for deinkability testing is
              INGEDE Method 11. Occasionally is being discussed whether it is
              relevant for all deinking processes, not only in Europe, also in
              the US. The procedure allows a solid assessment under standard
              conditions but is not meant to simulate every detail of a deinking

              such owners to return equipment they no longer want. In the
              electronics industry, generally these programs are run by specific
              manufacturers, but any brand of equipment can be returned. Due to
              this spurt in end-of-life product recycling programs a new problem

              electronic product, characterized by different model, year, brand,
              type, material etc., are entering recycler's warehouses. To attain
              sustainable and environmentally sound product recycling these
              products have to be first disassembled and recycled for material
              recovery. Recyclers are also required to ensure that hazardous
              waste is treated separately while recycling. Lack of information
              on disassembly methods and material information on these products
              could lead to incoherent decisions. This could affect profit
              margins as well as lead to inappropriate end-of-life treatment. An
              information system is therefore needed to aid decision making for

              of settlements and health. It gives a brief introduction to the
              issues before summarising the evidence in relation to a range of
              topics, concluding with some more speculative thoughts on likely
              future findings. Modern planning was invented in response to
              inhumane living conditions in 19th century cities. But in the last
              century the connection was lost. Only now, with concerns over
              climate change and obesity, is there beginning to be the
              realisation that the physical environment is an important
              determinant of health. The paper uses a particular model of this
              relationship based on eco-system and health determinants theories
              to structure the review of evidence. The review covers: lifestyle
              choices in relation to physical activity and diet, mental
              well-being and community, the local economy and income, health
              inequalities and strategic land use transport planning, pollution
              and urban form, and finally impacts on global ecology. There is
              now a growing consensus that while personal factors are critical
              in determining health, the urban environment exacerbates or
              mitigates health and well-being outcomes. The level of active
              travel (walking and cycling) and outdoor recreational activity is
              strongly affected by accessibility to local facilities. Access to
              green, natural environments, and to local social networks, are
              factors in mental well-being. The wider sub-regional pattern of
              housing, economic development, land use and transport is a
              determinant of social exclusion and therefore health inequalities.
              It also affects health-damaging pollution, adaptability in the
              face of climate change and the level of carbon dioxide emissions.
              We have literally been building unhealthy conditions into many of
              our towns and cities. But comparisons with the best cities in
              Europe indicate that it is possible to reverse the less desirable
              trends. Success depends, however, on more radical policies of
              local authority control over land and finance than any political
              party has yet advocated. It also requires collaboration between
              the full range of powerful public and private organizations that
              influence the built environment. Future research is likely to
              further strengthen these conclusions. It will become much more
              obvious that planning for health and well-being is not only the
              NHS, but about creating a health-promoting physical, social and
              economic environment. © 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of

               generation, water usage and the environmental impact of the
               manufactured part in service. This paper deals with three aspects
               of sustainability as it applies to additive manufacturing. First
               is a review of the research needs for energy and sustainability
               as applied to additive manufacturing based on the 2009 Roadmap
               for Additive Manufacturing Workshop. The second part is an energy
               assessment for selective laser sintering (SLS) of polymers. Using
               polyamide powder in a 3D Systems Vanguard HiQ Sinterstation,
               energy loss during a build was measured due to the chamber
               heaters, the roller mechanism, the piston elevators and the
               laser. This accounted for 95\% of the total energy consumption.
               An overall energy assessment was accomplished using
               eco-indicators. The last topic is electrochemical deposition of
               porous SLS non-polymeric preforms. The goal is to reduce energy
               consumption in SLS of non-polymeric materials. The approach was
               to mix a transient binder with the material, to create an SLS
               green part, to convert the binder, and then to remove the open,
               connected porosity and to densify the part by chemical deposition
               at room temperature within the pore network. The model system was
               silicon carbide powder mixed with a phenolic transient binder
               coupled with electrolytic deposition of nickel. Deposition was
               facilitated by inserting a conductive graphite cathode in the
               part center to draw the positive nickel ions through the
               interconnected porous network and to deposit them on the pore

              remaining 30\%-40\% solids content is not subject to local and/or
              federal rules concerning disposal and safe handling. It required
              that water-based inks be handled in much the same manner as
              platisol inks. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must accompany

               aware. While automation and related computing activities continue

               Green ICT continues to chip away at the 'resigned' views of the
               decision makers to environmental responsibilities. ICT operates
               at systems level, applications level, at the end-user level

              devices and has a significant positive ecological impact. Existing

              hardcopy in toner saving mode is worse in comparison with normal
              mode; processing of whole rendered page bitmap requires
              significant computational costs. We propose to add small holes of
              various shapes and sizes to random places inside a character
              bitmap stored in font cache. Such random perforation scheme is
              based on processing pipeline in RIP of standard printer languages

              moreover, processing of each character for given font and size
              alone, is an extremely fast procedure. The approach does not
              deteriorate halftoned bitmap and business graphics and provide
              toner saving for typical office documents up to 15-20\%. Rate of
              toner saving is adjustable. Alteration of resulted characters'
              appearance is almost indistinguishable in comparison with solid
              black text due to random placement of small holes inside the
              character regions. The suggested method automatically skips small
              fonts to preserve its quality. Readability of text processed by
              proposed method is fine. OCR programs process that scanned

              the quality and production of the measuring device are regularly
              tested and undergo strict control by way of the TÜV-Süd. The new
              device no longer has a film keyboard but a Touchpad. Immediately
              after connecting the high resolution TFT color monitor, the
              measuring device indicates readiness. The simple operation is
              eased by a color-supported menu. The identification of the
              measurement program is completely clear, namely, exhaust gas
              measurement - green; temperature measurement - blue; pressure
              measurement - yellow. A status line indicates the device and
              program specific information. The color changes if a limit is
              exceeded and/or a function line indicates relevant and program
              related information such as selected fuel, time, and date.

              via a system-independent Micro-SD card up to 4 GB storage
              capacity. An improved sensor technology is also incorporated using
              for the first time a hydrogen-compensated CO measurement. The
              measurement operation is Multi-Tasking. There are separate
              measurement programs for pressure and temperature difference. The
              device has self diagnosis. A fuel-specific dew point is
              integrated. Operation up to 10 hr in eco-mode is possible.

              the past two decades: filmed metal oxides as external additives
              and carbon black as the essential pigment. Market forces driving
              this evolution and increasing additive diversity are the demand
              for high speed office printers and commercial digital presses and
              the need for low priced laser printers to make small office and
              home (SOHO) use affordable. Additionally, ecofriendly printers
              with reduced energy consumption and zero emissions require the
              development of toner with low fusing temperatures (low T g) based
              on environmentally safe raw materials. Novel fumed
              silicon/titanium mixed oxides offer the positive tribo-charging
              benefits of titanium dioxide combined with the surface properties
              of silica. Acting as effective spacers that prevent
              re-agglomeration of low T g toner, fumed sub-micron particles
              based on both silica and titania have distinct advantages over
