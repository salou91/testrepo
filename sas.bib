                   identified with the rare population of hyper-luminous, hot
                   dust-obscured galaxies. Galaxy formation models predict
                   these systems to grow via mergers, that can deliver large
                   amounts of gas toward their centers, induce intense bursts
                   of star formation and feed their supermassive black holes.
                   Here we report the detection of 24 galaxies emitting
                   Lyman-alpha emission on projected physical scales of about
                   400 kpc around the hyper-luminous hot dust-obscured galaxy
                   W0410-0913, at redshift z = 3.631, using Very Large
                   Telescope observations. While this indicates that W0410-0913
                   evolves in a very dense environment, we do not find clear
                   signs of mergers that could sustain its growth. Data suggest
                   that if mergers occurred, as models expect, these would
                   involve less massive satellites, with only a moderate impact
                   on the internal interstellar medium of W0410-0913, which is
                   sustained by a rotationally-supported fast-rotating

  author        = "Realpe-G{\'o}mez, John",
  abstract      = "Embodied cognition posits that action and perception
                   co-determine each other, forming an action-perception loop.
                   This suggests that we humans somehow participate in what we
                   perceive. So, how can scientists escape the
                   action-perception loop to obtain an observer-independent
                   description of the world? Here we model scientists engaged
                   in the practice of science and argue that to achieve such a
                   feat scientists must describe the world with the tools of
                   quantum theory. This aligns with growing evidence suggesting
                   that in quantum theory facts are relative. We argue that
                   embodiment, as traditionally understood, can entail
                   imaginary-time quantum dynamics. However, we argue that an
                   embodied scientist interacting with an experimental system
                   must be described from the perspective of another scientist,
                   which is ignored in traditional approaches to embodied
                   cognition. To describe the world without any reference to
                   external observers we take two steps. First, we assume that
                   observers play complementary roles as both objects
                   experienced by other observers and ``subjects'' that
                   experience other objects -- here the word ``subject'' is
                   used in a strict technical sense as the opposite of object.
                   Second, like two mirrors reflecting each other as well as
                   another object, we have to assume that two (sets of)
                   observers mutually observe each other as well as the
                   experimental system. This entails two coupled imaginary-time
                   quantum dynamics that can be written as the imaginary and
                   real parts of a genuine, real-time quantum dynamics. We
                   discuss some potential implications of our work.",

                   the distinct eigenstate phases of quantum chaotic and
                   many-body localized systems. We focus on two related
                   quantities - the spectral form factor and the density of all
                   spectral gaps and show that they furnish unique signatures
                   that can be used to sharply identify the two phases. We
                   demonstrate this by numerically studying three
                   one-dimensional quantum spin chain models with (i) quenched
                   disorder, (ii) periodic drive (Floquet) and (iii)

                   signatures are universal and in what ways they are not. More
                   generally, this thorough analysis is expected to play a

                   (W0116-0505), a heavily obscured hyper-luminous quasar at
                   $z=3.173$ classified as a Hot, Dust-Obscured Galaxy (Hot
                   DOG) based on its mid-IR colors. Recently, Assef et al.
                   (2020) identified W0116-0505 as having excess rest-frame
                   optical/UV emission, and concluded this excess emission is
                   most likely scattered light from the heavily obscured AGN.
                   We find that the broad-band rest-frame UV flux is strongly
                   linearly polarized (10.8$\pm$1.9\%, with a polarization
                   angle of 74$\pm$9~deg), confirming this conclusion. We
                   analyze these observations in the context of a simple model
                   based on scattering either by free electrons or by optically
                   thin dust, assuming a classical dust torus with polar
                   openings. Both can replicate the degree of polarization and
                   the luminosity of the scattered component for a range of
                   geometries and column densities, but we argue that optically
                   thin dust in the ISM is the more likely scenario. We also
                   explore the possibility that the scattering medium
                   corresponds to an outflow recently identified for
                   W0116-0505. This is a feasible option if the outflow
                   component is bi-conical with most of the scattering
                   occurring at the base of the receding outflow. In this
                   scenario the quasar would still be obscured even if viewed
                   face on, but might appear as a reddened type 1 quasar once
                   the outflow has expanded. We discuss a possible connection
                   between blue-excess Hot DOGs, extremely red quasars (ERQs),
                   reddened type 1 quasars, and unreddened quasars that depends
                   on a combination of evolution and viewing geometry.",
