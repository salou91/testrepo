  abstract  = "Purpose: The range of applications of the currently available
               biomass selective laser sintering (SLS) parts is limited and
               low-quality. This study aims to demonstrate the effects of the
               various processing parameters on the dimensional accuracy,
               bending strength, tensile strength, density and impact strength
               of the Prosopis chilensis/polyethersulfone (PES) composites
               (PCPCs) that were produced by SLS. The various processing
               parameters are laser power, scan speed, preheating temperature,
               scan spacing and layer thickness. In addition, the authors’
               studied the effects of PCP particle size on the mechanical
               properties of the PCPCs. Design/methodology/approach: The PCPC
               specimens were printed using an AFS SLS machine (additive
               manufacturing). The bending, tensile and impact strengths of the
               specimens were measured using a universal tensile tester. The
               dimensional accuracy of the bending specimens was determined by a
               Vernier caliper. The formability of the PCPC at various mixing
               ratios of the raw materials was earlier investigated by
               single-layer sintering experiments (Idriss et al., 2020b). The
               microstructure and particle distribution of the various PCPC
               specimens were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
               Findings: The mechanical strengths (bending, tensile and impact
               strengths and density) and the dimensional accuracy of the PCPC
               SLS parts were directly and inversely proportional, respectively,
               to the laser power and preheating temperature. Furthermore, the
               mechanical strengths and dimensional accuracy of the PCPC SLS
               parts were inversely and directly proportional, respectively, to
               the scanning speed, scan spacing and layer thickness. Practical
               implications: PCPC is an inexpensive, energy-efficient material
               that can address the drawbacks of the existing SLS parts. It is
               also eco-friendly because it lowers the pollution and CO2
               emissions that are associated with waste disposal and SLS,
               respectively. The optimization of the processing parameters of
               SLS in this study produced high-quality PCPC parts with high
               mechanical strengths and dimensional accuracy that could be used
               for the manufacture of the roof and wooden floors, construction
               components and furniture manufacturing. Originality/value: To the
               best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is among the first to
               elucidate the impact of the various SLS processing parameters on
               the mechanical properties and dimensional accuracy of the
               sintered parts. Furthermore, novel PCPC parts were produced in
               this study by SLS. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

  abstract  = "3D printing is the most popular form of additive manufacturing,
               and conductive 3D-printed platforms have been recognized as an
               emerging class of devices with high potential for
               electrochemistry. Nevertheless, as-printed electrodes provide
               poor conductivity due to the presence of high amounts of
               insulating thermoplastic material, requiring surface
               post-treatments to enhance their electrochemical performance.
               Such treatments often employ non-eco-friendly, costly, and
               time-consuming protocols. In this regard, we propose, for the
               first time, a sub-minute (around 50 s) and reagentless surface
               treatment of carbon-black/PLA-based 3D-printed electrodes using a
               Photo-Thermal approach by a CO2 laser. After the proposed
               treatment (optimized conditions: the power of 6.2\%, the scan
               rate of 20 mm s−1, and height of 10 mm), a marked improvement in
               the electrochemical electrode response (current increase and
               peak-to-peak separation) was achieved towards the detection of
               catechol, ascorbic and uric acids, paracetamol,
               hexaammineruthenium(III) chloride, and Ferri/ferrocyanide redox
               couple. The enhanced simultaneous determination of Cd2+, Pb2+,
               and Cu2+ was also demonstrated. As a proof-of-concept, the
               quantification of the adulterant paracetamol in a real seized
               cocaine sample was performed using a fully 3D-printed
               electrochemical system, and a good recovery value of 97.8\% was
               acquired. To explain all the improved results, the electrode was
               carefully characterized by imaging, spectroscopic and
               electrochemical techniques. Additionally, the between-measurement
               \% relative standard deviation (\%RSD) was 6.8\% (n = 12), while
               the between-device \%RSD was 7.5\% (n = 6) at the 1 µmol L-1
               paracetamol, indicating adequate manufacturing reproducibility.
               Thus, the strategies developed here open up new possibilities for
               applications of carbon-based 3D-printed electrodes in analytical
               electrochemistry. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",

               manufacturing (AM) has increased. Taking into account
               environmental problems and sustainability, manufacturers are now
               also considering the environmental and sustainability criteria in
               their decision-making process. The sustainability concept is
               known as the triple-bottom line, namely, economic, social and
               environmental perspectives. Sustainable concept selection in the
               manufacturing organisation can be considered as the selection of
               sustainable material, product design, process, method and
               technology. This study aims to select an appropriate AM process
               by considering sustainability from various available techniques.
               Design/methodology/approach: Appropriate sustainable performance
               indicators for the AM were identified based on literature as well
               as in discussion with experts and decision-makers. The model
               addresses all the major dimensions of sustainable concepts of AM
               such as material/product quality, machine performance, market
               stability, total cost and ecological values. A hybrid
               multi-criteria decision-making approach, i.e. stepwise weight
               assessment ratio analysis and complex proportional assessment
               methods, have been used to select the best AM technique. While
               selecting criteria affecting AM machines and processes, criteria
               based on the sustainable concept are considered. Findings: Among
               the four selected AM processes, i.e. fused diffusion modelling
               (FDM), laminated object manufacturing (LOM), stereolithography
               apparatus (SLA) and selective laser sintering (SLS), the best
               alternative was found to be FDM. Research
               limitations/implications: The present study highlights some
               limitations in the selection of AM process and methodology used
               in this research. This study considers only four AM processes,
               i.e. FDM, LOM, SLA and SLS. Future work may include considering
               other AM processes and criteria that affect the sustainability of
               AM. Practical implications: The present work will help
               researchers and production managers to decide the best AM
               alternatives to fabricate desired parts. Hence, AM can help in
               maximum energy utilisation, optimal consumption of resources,
               minimum material wastage and reduction of CO2 emission.
               Originality/value: The study considers some important criteria,
               including energy consumption, eco-friendly and wastage-free
               production, that help sustainable AM. This study can result in a
               good economic efficiency of AM industries and, therefore,
               positively impact customers using green products. © 2022, Emerald

               consumption, and improve workmanship. The 3D-printed concrete
               technology (3DPCT), more broadly recognized as the design of a 3D
               object via a computer-aided design (CAD) model or a digital 3D
               model, has accelerated considerable progress in these areas in
               other industries. Although 3DPCT has advanced remarkably in
               recent years, producing an appropriate 3D printing material that
               improves performance while reducing material consumption, which
               is really important for CO2 reduction, is urgently needed. The
               present 3DPCT faces many obstacles, one of which is the limited
               range of printable concretes. To tackle this limitation,
               extensive studies on developing creative approaches for
               formulating alkali-activated materials (AAMs) for 3DPCT for
               modern building applications have been conducted. AAMs are
               maintainable substitutive binders to ordinary Portland cement.
               Therefore, the need to undertake a comprehensive literature
               review on the current status of AAM performance on 3D-printable
               concretes for building applications is substantial. This article
               comprehensively reviews the quality requirements, advantages,
               disadvantages, common techniques, delivery, and placement of
               3DCP. This literature also delivers indepth reviews on the
               behaviors and the properties of AAM-based concrete composites
               used in 3D-printed construction. Moreover, research trends are
               moving toward a wide-ranging understanding concerning the
               economic benefits and the environmental footprints of 3DCP for
               building applications with AAMs as suitable concrete materials
               for the emerging robust eco-friendly concrete composite for
               digital construction constructions nowadays. Given the merits of
               the study, several hotspot research topics for future
               investigations are also provided for facilitating the wide use of
               3DPCT in real applications to address rapidly the gap between

               of new processes (such 3D printing) and materials (such as
               renewably sourced resins). To enable a fast transition to
               high-quality, sustainable plastic applications, a specific
               methodology could be a key competitive advantage. This novel
               methodology is focused on improving the objectivity and
               efficiency of plastic production and the design review process.
               It is applicable to discrete optimization events in any product
               lifecycle milestone, from concept design to serial production
               stages. The methodology includes a natural way to capture
               plastic-related knowledge and trends, oriented towards building a
               dynamic “interaction matrix”, with a list of potential
               optimizations and their positive or negative impacts in a
               comprehensive set of multi-criteria evaluations. With an
               innovative approach, the matrix allows the possibility to
               incorporate a business strategy, which could be different at
               every lifecycle stage. The business strategy is translated from
               the common “verbal” definition into a quantitative set of “Target
               and Restrictions”, making it possible to detect and prioritize
               the best potential design optimization changes according to the
               strategy. This methodology helps to model and compare design
               alternatives, verify impacts in every evaluation criteria, and
               make robust and objective information-based decisions. The
               application of the methodology in real cases of plastic material
               design optimization in the automotive industry has provided
               remarkable results, accelerating the detection of improvement
               methods aligned with the strategy and maximizing the improvement
               in product competitiveness and sustainability. In comparison with

               the case of concrete, it encounters significant challenges in
               terms of material design, since high paste volumes and Portland
               cement contents are normally used due to process requirements. In
               this article, the application to layered extrusion of a recently
               developed low clinker cement containing 50\% Portland cement and
               50\% supplementary cementitious materials, such as limestone,
               burnt oil shale, and fly ash, is presented. It is found that an
               accelerator paste composed by Calcium Aluminate Cement (CAC) and

               for 3D printing, while not compromising the early and long-term
               compressive strength. Such a low clinker mortar can be
               successfully retarded, processed, pumped, and extruded just after
               mixing it in line with the accelerator paste. This accelerated
               mortar formulation contains only 303 kg/m3 of Portland cement,

               composites have emerged as a strong contender for replacing
               conventional concrete in diverse construction applications.
               Critical analysis of the literature on innovative production

               novel printing setup employs a low-cost printer to print a
               plastic-based filament and a conductive silver ink paste
               simultaneously. As there were no printers available in the market
               for this application, the open-source fused filament fabrication
               (FFF) printer was modified to accommodate two extruders mounted
               on the same extruder carriage. Techcon TS250 air pressure
               dispenser was employed for the extrusion of silver ink. Extension
               pieces for the extruder carriage were also 3-D printed using a
               fused deposition modeling (FDM) printer to reduce the production
               costs. A bandstop FSS comprising of square loop elements was
               designed to demonstrate the full fabrication. The FSS operated at
               a central frequency of 2.55 GHz and provided a good angle of
               response with wide bandwidths. Surface profiles of the printed
               FSS and substrate demonstrate the reliable fabrication of the FSS
               design. This full 3-D printing method provides an economical,
               eco-friendly, swift, reliable, and viable substitute for the
               fabrication of FSS designs that could be highly customized in
               terms of fabricating 3-D FSS designs with reliable performances.

               avoid the entry of this toxic pollutant into the ecosystem.
               Therefore, we developed a low-cost graphene (Gr)-printed paper
               electrode for determination of H2O2 using cyclic voltammetry
               (CV). An office inkjet-printer and Gr nano-ink stabilized with

               demonstrates the proof-of-concept of the set-on-demand approach

               concept by assessing the yield strength development rates of
               fresh concrete for varying mix design parameters. With a suitable
               mix design is chosen, a modular in-line dynamic mixing equipment

               However, the relatively restricted range of 3D printable
               biocomposites decelerated its adoption in the biomedical sector
               as a conventional manufacturing technique. In this method, the
               introduction of biofillers with unique properties to produce high
               performance composites as printing feedstocks are increasingly
               recommended. The interest in using eco-friendly fillers from

               low-cost poly(lactic acid) (PLA) composites is recently
               increased. In this work, a series of PLA biocomposites filled
               with calcined seashell (CSh) particles have been prepared by melt
               mixing technique using a twin-screw extruder, and characterized

               the enhancement of the various mechanical properties. Where, by
               adding 10 wt\% of treated CSh, the tensile modulus and strength
               were significantly increased from 183.8 ± 4.7 MPa and 29.81 ± 1.8
               MPa to 241.9 ± 63 MPa and 49.06 ± 8.87 MPa, respectively,
               compared to the virgin PLA. In addition, respected to PLA matrix,
               the compressive moduli of the printed specimens of PLA/5CSh and
               PLA/10CSh biocomposite filaments exhibited improvements of 5\%
               and 14\%, respectively. Moreover, the thermal analysis showed a
               marked improvement in the thermal stability of the elaborated
               biocomposites, where the degradation temperature (Td50) have been
               upgraded by 4°C for the biocomposite containing 10 wt\% of CSh
