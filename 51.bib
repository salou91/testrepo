              amphibian field guides as identification character into species.
              Sometimes, this could lead to misidentification due to different
              formulas within one species. Hydrophylax chalconotus (Anura:
              Ranidae) and Duttaphrynus melanostictus (Anura; Bufonidae) are
              common anurans species around the human activity area such as
              garden, pool, and other habitats. This research was aimed at
              describing the development of labial tooth row formula (LTRF) of
              H. chalconotus and D. melanostictus during metamorphosis.
              Specimens were taken from several locations in Sleman Regency,
              Yogyakarta Special Province. This research was done by collecting
              and rearing tadpoles from eggs into larvae. The observation was
              conducted using stereo microscope. Premetamorphosis phase (stage
              17-35) was determined based on Gosner (1960), while LTRF was
              determined based on Iskandar (1995). The LTRF development of each
              species was noted and recorded. Results show that Jirst LTRF of H.
              chalconotus could be seen from stage 25 and gradually changed into
              complex structure until stage 35. Meanwhile, first LTRF of D.
              melanostictus could be shown from the stage 24 and remain
              unchanged until stage 35. Based on the observation, it can be
              concluded that the variation of LTRF was the result of
              development, and that some differences on same stages indicating
              variation within species. Thus, it is recommended that
              identification using LTRF should also consider the stage of the
              tadpoles development. This preliminary researh should be followed
              by similar research using different species. Kewords: tadpole,

              habitat of herpetofauna in Yogyakarta. The secondary forest area
              was known to be the most suitable habitat for herpetofauna.
              Research to enlist amphibians and reptiles in the area has been
              done by Eprilurahman and Muharromi in 2008. They reported 20
              species of amphibians and reptiles in southern slope of Merapi.
              They were 9 species of amphibians and 11 species of reptiles. The
              amphibians were belong to Family of Ranidae, Bufonidae,
              Rhacophoridae and Megophryidae. Meanwhile, the reptile were member
              of Viperidae, Scincidae, Gekkonidae, and Agamidae family. After
              2008, the research was continued in 2009 and 2010 and
              significantly added I8 new recorded species to the list. The new
              recorded species consisted of 3 species of Rhacophoridae, 1
              species of Megophryidae, 10 species of Colubridae, 1 species of
              Scincidae, 1 species of Agamidae, and 2 species of Gekkonidae.

              with nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (nucleoside
              analogues) remains uncertain. We studied treatment with regimens
              that combined two nucleoside analogues, at least one of which was
              new, with the protease inhibitor nelfinavir, the nonnucleoside
              reverse-transcriptase inhibitor efavirenz, or both. METHODS: The
              study included 195 patients who had been treated with nucleoside
              analogues only, and had a plasma HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA level of
              at least 500 copies per milliliter. Patients were randomly
              assigned to receive, in addition to two nucleoside analogues,
              nelfinavir, efavirenz, or nelfinavir plus efavirenz. The primary
              end point was a plasma HIV-1 RNA level of less than 500 copies per
              milliliter at week 16. A secondary end point was the composite of
              the HIV-1 RNA levels measured at weeks 40 and 48. RESULTS: At week
              16 and at weeks 40 and 48, the proportions of patients in whom a
              plasma HIV-1 RNA level of less than 500 copies per milliliter was
              achieved were, respectively, 81 percent and 74 percent in the
              nelfinavir-plus-efavirenz group, 69 percent and 60 percent in the
              efavirenz group, and 64 percent and 35 percent in the nelfinavir
              group. Quadruple therapy resulted in a higher rate of viral
              suppression in both the short term (P=0.03) and the long term
              (P=0.001) than did triple therapy with nelfinavir. Triple therapy
              with efavirenz conferred a higher rate of long-term suppression
              than triple therapy with nelfinavir (P=0.004). Quadruple therapy
              also achieved a higher rate of virologic suppression than triple
              therapy with efavirenz (P=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In HIV-infected
              patients previously treated with nucleoside analogues, treatment
              with nelfinavir plus efavirenz and at least one new nucleoside
              analogue achieves a higher rate of viral suppression than do
              regimens with nucleoside analogues and nelfinavir or efavirenz
