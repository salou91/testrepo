               bumetanide in human urine samples for the detection of doping in
               sports. The method involves the use of a paper platform and
               digital image detection and is based on the reaction between
               bumetanide, p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde (p-DAC), and HCl in a
               methanolic medium, yielding a colored compound in a delimited
               area on a qualitative filter paper. The concentrations of p-DAC
               and HCl were optimized by a chemometric experimental design.
               After the addition of the reagents to the paper, digital images
               were obtained by scanning in a multifunctional printer and
               analyzed using the RGB pattern. The linear bumetanide
               concentration range was 6.90 × 10 −5 –1.37 × 10 −3 mol L −1 with
               R 2 = 0.993 and the limits of detection (LOD) and quantification
               (LOQ) were 3.60 × 10 −4 and 1.09 × 10 −4 mol L −1 , respectively.
               A SPE clean-up step for the samples were required to eliminate
               the interference of urinary urea. The recoveries obtained varied
               from 94\% to 105\%, indicating the absence of significant matrix
               effects or interferences in urine samples after clean-up step.
               The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of
               bumetanide in human urine samples. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

               various assistive robot systems including humanoid robots have
               been developed. Humanoid robotic hands are one of the most useful
               parts to assist humans efficiently. While sensing pressure or
               temperature from the robotic hands is extensively studied,
               sensing chemicals is less widely studied despite the significant
               importance. Here, a unique platform of smartly moving humanoid
               fingers actuated by chemical sensing is reported. The sensor is
               printed with disposable and biocompatible cellulose conductive
               ink materials. Rf intensity change of the sensor with NH4 +
               membrane depends on NH4 + ion concentration where R² is 0.9576.
               The smart bending motion of a finger is accomplished by logically
               programed actuation through detecting the change of interested
               ion concentration from 0.01 to 1 m at the ion-selective membrane
               electrode (ISME) sensor with resulted bending angles from 10° to
               67° accordingly. The overall signal-to-noise ratio is over 10.
               This sensing robot concept may be expanded to applications of

               last decade. It shows great potential in reducing the need for
               energy- and resource-intensive manufacturing processes, which in
               turn reduces the amount of material required in the supply chain,
               and enables more environmentally benign practices. However, the
               question of how to realize these potential benefits has received
               little attention. This paper aims to provide an overview of the
               Sustainability of Additive Manufacturing (SAM). The context of
               the SAM is introduced, with a focus on energy and environmental
               impacts. Resource consumption is identified as the most important
               aspect. Examination from a life cycle perspective is also
               presented, with explicit discussions on opportunities to reduce
               energy and material consumption through design, material
               preparation, manufacturing, usage, and end-of-life treatment.
               Statistical data analysis provides an overview of impact
               forecasts, highlighting the importance of and need for thorough
               research on sustainability. The eco-design concept enabled by AM
               is identified as the most promising and effective technology,
               further extending and completing its design capability. This also
               determines the opportunities for energy and environmental
               optimization in subsequent processes. Most existing research is
               in process- and system-specific modeling, and few AM processes

               conclusions. General models for each type of AM process are still

               improve systematic data integration and management, correlate
               energy and quality, develop intelligent machinery, focus on
               material preparation and recycling, and discover innovative

              manufacturer from Bolder, Colorado, awarded a contract to the
              company to make a new line of folding cartons for it. The solution
              for making the new line of folding cartons involved putting seeds
              directly into the biodegradable packaging, while using 100 percent
              recycled raw materials. Molded Fiber Division of UFP Technologies
              Inc., had to adopt a means of really tracking the process
              carefully so that it was able to develop the right ratio of seeds
              to slurry for the new line of folding cartons.",

               eliminating the use of Portland cement. However, inherent
               problems with 3D printing concrete lie in the low tensile

               increase of complexity of the products. At the same time, it is
               becoming more and more difficult to justify the expected product
               features while satisfying the requirements of the trends like
               eco-design, resource efficiency, light weight design and
               individualization. These developments are key characteristics
               which favor the growing role and importance of additive
               manufacturing (AM). Additive Manufacturing techniques such as
               Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)
               or Selective Laser Melting (SLM) are transitions from building
               prototypes to manufacturing series products within short time and
               with highest requirements regarding material characteristics as
               well as product performance. Product performance is one of the
               main drivers of the creation of multi-material composites. These
               composites, existing of a matrix and embedded fibers, are more
               and more used in various industries not just the aerospace and
               automotive industry. They offer a solution to the light-weight
               requirements amongst others. Yet, so far the manufacturing of
               composites is only partially automated; it requires a lot of
               manual labor and is typically requiring tools resulting in added
               costs. A combination or integration of additive and composite
               manufacturing is very limited to not existing, being an indicator
               for the difficulties to bring these two technologies together. To
               meet this challenge the 3D Fiber Print has been developed. It is
               an AM method using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and composites
               in process simultaneously while manufacturing a product. The

               containing a composite on-demand. The newly developed and
               patented print head is designed in the way that composite and
               matrix material are applied in the right setup and ration using a
               nozzle style print head to completely embed the composite. This

              function that most organisational carbon management programmes
              entered corporate consciousness. At a time when the remit of the
              IT function itself was being undermined by executive forces
              alleging that IT was neither flexible nor amenable to the needs of
              'the business', the environmentalist debate gave IT heads a
              platform to re-assert their status in the management hierarchy. It
              also restored some of the political clout IT formerly enjoyed: it
              was re-empowered to drive through changes.The economy is looking
              healthier now, and the green IT 'agenda' has moved on since 2005.
              The CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme legislation has introduced a
              legal motivation for organisations to review their energy usage
              and take steps to implement policies and procedures that make
              carbon control intrinsic to the articles of their governance.
              However, as the recent Green Enterprise World Forum showed, the IT
              industry has passed beyond the awareness phase and must now
              concentrate its talents on shaping the the future green IT.The
              pursuit of green IT is perforce subject also to changes in working
              practices. The gradual but steady trend toward the so-called
              mobile enterprise is going to have important repercussions on the
              way IT is provisioned to business users and on the way it consumes
              energy. With mobile devices enabling large percentages of the
              workforce to work away from an office base, the requirement to
              provision multiple desktops (or docking stations), each with a
              network connection and power source, will become less crucial; and
              printer needs will decrease.",

               Currently, 3D printing processing technology for ceramic shaping

               reducing global warming and promoting energy-saving measures than
               ever before. This has led to the development of eco-friendly
               manufacturing systems to replace conventional ones. Additive
               manufacturing (AM) technology, for instance, is expected to
               contribute to reducing material costs and energy consumption.
               Unlike conventional material-cutting manufacturing processes, AM
               enables designs of any shape in manufacturing by adding the
               necessary parts layer by layer. Direct energy deposition (DED) is
               one of the many AM technologies available for a variety of
               commercial steel powders such as P20, P21, SUS420, H13, D2 and
               other Non-ferrous metal powders. The DED is process that can be
               applied to various industries, like molding, medicine, and
               defense. Of these, its application to the molding industry is the
               most practical, since the process can be used to deposit
               different materials on existing parts. Using this technology, it
               becomes possible to manufacture high-functioning parts composed
               of various materials at reasonable cost. In this study, the DED
               is used to develop a high-performance and environmentally
               friendly trimming die. In this study, to develop a high
               performance and environmentally friendly trimming die using DED,
               evaluation of mechanical properties of material developed, stress
               analysis in shear work. The commercialization of the developed
               technology was evaluated and the commercial application of the
               developed technology was discussed. © 2018, Korean Society for

               economy and flexibility. Herein, we fabricated the inkjet-printed
               paper-based semiconducting SERS substrates for the first time via
               an inexpensive office inkjet printer with representative
               two-dimensional MoO3-x nanosheets ink. Compared with conventional
               substrates, these paper-based semiconducting substrates not only
               could meet the requirements of simple and large-scale
               preparation, but also realize efficient sample collection by
               merely swabbing the surface. We obtained the detection limit
               concentration of rhodamine 6G as low as 10-7 M. Furthermore,
               these flexible paper-based substrates were successfully applied

               biomass selective laser sintering (SLS) parts is limited and
               low-quality. This study aims to demonstrate the effects of the
               various processing parameters on the dimensional accuracy,
               bending strength, tensile strength, density and impact strength
               of the Prosopis chilensis/polyethersulfone (PES) composites
               (PCPCs) that were produced by SLS. The various processing
               parameters are laser power, scan speed, preheating temperature,
               scan spacing and layer thickness. In addition, the authors’
               studied the effects of PCP particle size on the mechanical
               properties of the PCPCs. Design/methodology/approach: The PCPC
               specimens were printed using an AFS SLS machine (additive
               manufacturing). The bending, tensile and impact strengths of the
               specimens were measured using a universal tensile tester. The
               dimensional accuracy of the bending specimens was determined by a
               Vernier caliper. The formability of the PCPC at various mixing
               ratios of the raw materials was earlier investigated by
               single-layer sintering experiments (Idriss et al., 2020b). The
               microstructure and particle distribution of the various PCPC
               specimens were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
               Findings: The mechanical strengths (bending, tensile and impact
               strengths and density) and the dimensional accuracy of the PCPC
               SLS parts were directly and inversely proportional, respectively,
               to the laser power and preheating temperature. Furthermore, the
               mechanical strengths and dimensional accuracy of the PCPC SLS
               parts were inversely and directly proportional, respectively, to
               the scanning speed, scan spacing and layer thickness. Practical
               implications: PCPC is an inexpensive, energy-efficient material
               that can address the drawbacks of the existing SLS parts. It is
               also eco-friendly because it lowers the pollution and CO2
               emissions that are associated with waste disposal and SLS,
               respectively. The optimization of the processing parameters of
               SLS in this study produced high-quality PCPC parts with high
               mechanical strengths and dimensional accuracy that could be used
               for the manufacture of the roof and wooden floors, construction
               components and furniture manufacturing. Originality/value: To the
               best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is among the first to
               elucidate the impact of the various SLS processing parameters on
               the mechanical properties and dimensional accuracy of the
               sintered parts. Furthermore, novel PCPC parts were produced in

               microfluidic thread-based electroanalytical device (μTED) for
               non-enzymatic glucose determination. Biochar was initially
               prepared from castor oil cake at 400 °C and activated by HNO3
               refluxing. Activation process promoted an increase of functional
               groups, surface area and porosity in comparison to precursor
               biochar. Activated biochar (AB) has shown an excellent
               performance to spontaneous preconcentration of Ni(II) ions. In
               alkaline conditions a stable voltammetric profile associated to
               Ni(OH)2/NiOOH redox pair was verified and a significant catalytic
               effect was observed in presence of glucose which was used for its
               monitoring. Microfluidic device was assembled at a plastic
               platform printed using 3D printer being easy to construction
               using low cost materials. Non-enzymatic amperometric glucose
               sensor coupled in μTED showed a good repeatability of 3.84\% for
               successive injections of glucose (n = 10), a constant flow rate
               of 1.11 µL s−1 and an analytical frequency of 61 injections per
               hour. A linear dynamic range (LDR) from 5.0 to 100.0 µmol L−1,
               limit of detection (LOD) of 0.137 µmol L−1 and limit of
               quantification (LOQ) 0.457 µmol L−1 glucose were obtained. The
               proposed device was applied to glucose determination in real
               biological samples of human saliva and blood serum. Finally, the
               method was considered a green analytical procedure with Eco-Scale

  abstract  = "3D printing technology has been used for rapid prototyping since
               1980's and is still developing in a way that can be used for
               customized products with complex design and miniature features.
               Among all the available 3D printing techniques, Fused Deposition
               Modeling (FDM) is one of the most widely used technologies
               because of its capability to build different structures by
               employing various materials. However, complexity of parts made by
               FDM is greatly limited by restriction of using support materials.
               Support materials are often used in FDM for several complex
               geometries such as fully suspended shapes, overhanging surfaces
               and hollow features. This paper describes an approach to 3D print
               a structure using silicone elastomer and polylactide fiber (PLA)
               by employing a novel support material that is soluble in water.
               This support material is melted sugar which can easily be
               prepared at a low cost. Sugar is a carbohydrate, which is found
               naturally in plants such as sugarcane and sugar beets; therefore,
               it is completely organic and eco-friendly. As another advantage,
               the time for removing this material from the part is considerably
               less than other commercially available support materials and it
               can be removed easily by warm water without leaving any trace.
               Experiments were done using an inexpensive desktop 3D printer to
               fabricate complex structures for use in soft robots. The results
               envision that further development of this system would contribute
               to a method of fabrication of complex parts with lower cost yet

  abstract = "When designing a print product, recyclability used to have little
              priority. In the last years it has become more important. Among
              other factors, the printing process itself is crucial for the
              re-use of a printed product - flexo, UV, inkjet, liquid toners as
              well as some adhesives can be challenges for the production of
              recycled graphic paper. With rising environmental awareness, paper
              recycling becomes a more and more important issue also in
              marketing of printers and - accordingly - in the development of a
              printer. But very little is known about coherences. During the
              recycling process, the ink is separated from the paper fibers
              dissolved in water, and then it has to be removed from the aqueous
              suspension. This is why current inkjet inks are almost impossible
              to deink. Field testing of the deinkability has been done for the
              last decade but without any rating system to evaluate a certain
              printed product. The European Recovered Paper Council (ERPC)
              adopted a Scoring System for Deinkability in 2008. This system is
              based on the evaluation of the deinkability according to INGEDE
              Method 11, a lab procedure that has been developed to evaluate and
              compare the challenge a printed product means for a paper
              recycling mill. In 2009, INGEDE began to establish a certificate
              confirming the deinkability of a printed product, serving frequent
              requests of both authorities and printing as well as printer
              industry. The certificate has already been accepted by the
              Austrian Consumer Organization VKI who was the first to include
              deinkability into the criteria for their eco-label for printed
              products. The underlying procedure for deinkability testing is
              INGEDE Method 11. Occasionally is being discussed whether it is
              relevant for all deinking processes, not only in Europe, also in
              the US. The procedure allows a solid assessment under standard
              conditions but is not meant to simulate every detail of a deinking

               well-developed porosity (0.24-0.74 cm3 g-1) and abundant

               this capacity, as well as to structurally and mechanically

               biomimetic approaches that recapitulate the native
               microenvironment of the tissue in terms of parallel-aligned
               structure and biophysical signals were shown to be effective. In
               this study, we have developed 3D printed aligned and electrically
               active scaffolds in which the electrical conductivity was
               provided by carbonaceous material (CM) derived from algae-based
               biomass. The synthesis of this conductive and functional CM
               consisted of eco-friendly synthesis procedure such as
               pre-carbonization and multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)
               catalysis. CM obtained from biomass via hydrothermal
               carbonization (CM-03) and its ash form (CM-03K) were doped within
               poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) matrix and 3D printed to form
               scaffolds with aligned fibers for structural biomimicry.
               Scaffolds were seeded with C2C12 mouse myoblasts and subjected to
               electrical stimulation during the in vitro culture. Enhanced
               myotube formation was observed in electroactive groups compared

               myotube formation and myotube maturity were significantly
               increased for CM-03 group after electrical stimulation. The
               results have therefore showed that the CM obtained from
               macroalgae biomass is a promising novel source for the production

  abstract  = "These days’ markets are flooded with products that manufacturers
               promote as green by adding one or two green attributes to a
               conventional product. They do so take advantage of consumers’
               willingness to pay higher for green products. We examine
               consumers’ perceptions of such products through a theoretical
               lens. From a theoretical grounding we predict that: H1a: When
               consumers’ motivation to process information is high, both
               high-priced green and greenwashed products will be perceived high
               in monetary sacrifice.H1b: When consumers’ motivation to process
               information is low, in comparison to a green product, the high
               price of a greenwashed product will be perceived high in monetary
               sacrifice.H2: Perceptions of ethicality will mediate the
               evaluation of green and greenwashed products. Study 1 Sixty
               undergraduate students participated in the main study for extra
               credits. We randomly assigned participants to one of the four
               conditions in a 2 (motivation; low, high) × 2 (greenness, green,
               greenwashed) between-subjects design. The participants viewed the
               stimuli which consisted of an all-in-one printer with either one
               (greenwashed) or six (green) eco-friendly attributes and a
               fictitious brand name (Envyo) with a price of \$399.99. We
               measured perceived monetary sacrifice, willingness to purchase
               the printer as well as three covariates. Results: An ANCOVA using
               individual preference for green products as a covariate showed a
               significant motivation x greenness effect on perceived sacrifice
               (F (1, 55) = 4.75, p 0.50). In low motivation conditions, the
               perceptions of sacrifice were higher for the greenwashed printer
               (Mgreen = 5.8, Mgreenwashed = 7.0; F (1, 29) = 7.27, p < 0.05).
               Study 2a Using an implicit association task (IAT), this study
               demonstrated the implicit association of greenwashing (green)
               with unethicality (ethicality) of the firm (Greenwald, McGhee, \&
               Schwartz, 1998). Forty-three undergraduate students participated
               in the IAT task. Results: Response times were significantly
               faster in the hypothesis-consistent blocks than those in the
               hypothesis-inconsistent blocks (F (1, 39) = 41.44, p < 0.001, D =
               100). Mean response time in the hypothesis-consistent categories
               was 1295 milliseconds, compared with 1727 milliseconds in the
               hypothesis-inconsistent categories. Study 2b In this study, we
               measured ethicality concerns explicitly to test for mediation.
               Fifty-nine participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk were randomly
               assigned to one of the two conditions in a single-factor
               (greenness, green vs. greenwashed) between-subjects design. We
               used the vignettes from Study 1 to manipulate greenness and to
               create a low motivation to process information. Results from
               mediation analysis indicate that greenness significantly
               predicted ethicality (β = 1.41; 95\% CI = 0.63 to 2.20), and
               ethicality significantly predicted perceived sacrifice (β =
               −0.23; 95\% CI = −0.45 to −0.02). As expected, ethicality
               mediated the relationship between level of greenness and
               perceptions of sacrifice (indirect effect = −0.33; 95\% CI =
               −0.76 to −0.03). © 2018, Academy of Marketing Science.",

               systems on flexible and eco-compatible substrates. In this
               research, we studied inkjet printing for the manufacturing of
               both interdigitated electrodes arrays (IDEAs), and a versatile
               system to monitor bacterial cultures by electrochemical impedance
               spectroscopy (EIS). In particular, we studied this biosensing
               system for the detection of bacteriophages by comparing its
               performance with standard microbiological methods. We performed
               electrical and morphological characterizations of the devices
               produced with a consumer-use inkjet printer with commercial AgNPs
               ink on flexible substrates, such as office paper, polyethylene
               (PET), and photo paper. We used light microscopy optical
               analysis, profilometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and
               scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging to define the objects
               resolution, their real dimensions, and thickness. We also
               investigated the devices' conductivity and layout, by EIS
               measurements with a standard buffer solution, i.e., phosphate
               buffered saline (PBS). Finally, we tested our system by
               monitoring Lactococcus lactis cultures and bacteriophage
               infection. We compared the results to those obtained by two
               standard microbiological methods in terms of response time,
               proving that our technique requires less than half the time of
               other methods and no specialized personnel. © 2019 by the

              life-cycle. In this contribution the key environmental aspects of
              modern dry toners are compiled. Particular emphasis is given to
              the requirements as described in the various application families
              of the German Blue Angel eco-label (Blauer Engel

              ones. Since the amendment in January / February 2004 not only the
              use of heavy metals, azodyes and other hazardous substances as
              evidenced by negative AMES test in toner are prohibited , but also
              maximum limits for emissions from toner have been defined for the
              first time. Maximum emission levels were established for volatile
              organic compounds, such as, in particular, benzene and styrene,
              for ozone and for dust. New stricter environmental requirements

              loose value for the original owner they are being channeled into
              recycling stream for reuse, remanufacturing and asset recovery.
              Product take-back programs set up reverse logistics processes for
              such owners to return equipment they no longer want. In the
              electronics industry, generally these programs are run by specific
              manufacturers, but any brand of equipment can be returned. Due to
              this spurt in end-of-life product recycling programs a new problem
              has been encountered on the business side. An increasing number of
              electronic product, characterized by different model, year, brand,
              type, material etc., are entering recycler's warehouses. To attain
              sustainable and environmentally sound product recycling these
              products have to be first disassembled and recycled for material
              recovery. Recyclers are also required to ensure that hazardous
              waste is treated separately while recycling. Lack of information
              on disassembly methods and material information on these products
              could lead to incoherent decisions. This could affect profit
              margins as well as lead to inappropriate end-of-life treatment. An
              information system is therefore needed to aid decision making for
              adopting best possible end-of-life strategy for electronic
              products. Proposed system provides easy access to recyclers on
              different electronic models about optimal disassembly sequence,
              cost and time, gives information on hazardous and precious element
              contents, and composition of different components. This paper
              presents the results of such a system developed at Texas Tech
              University and tested at a recycling facility. This system further
              allows environmental impact assessment of the electronic products
              based on their material inventory using Eco-Indicator 99 scores.
              These scores can be of significance in determining products or
              components which have the highest environment impact and should be
              given special attention while recycling. A personal computer,
              laptop, printer, server and a flat panel monitor were analyzed for
              this study. System architecture, product information and system

               large snow. A minimum tube length of 30mm, onset condition, is
               needed to ensure the complete formation of agglomerated
               mechanisms with recirculation flow, and thus ensure the formation
               of considerable agglomerated particles. Results also show that

  abstract  = "Amphipods have gained popularity as excellent bioindicators. They
               are important links in numerous food chains and have localized
               behavior that can be used to assess sediment toxicity and water
               quality. Bioassays performed with amphipods, however, largely
               still use 10–42 d static tests in large volumes, require manual
               manipulation of samples, and employ mortality, growth and
               reproduction as the major test criteria, which are time and
               labour intensive, and can be subject to “observer bias”. This
               work describes design and validation of a miniaturized,
               continuous perfusion based Lab-on-a-Chip technology for automated
               sub-lethal behavioral toxicity tests using the native Australian
               marine amphipod Allorchestes compressa. An automation module with
               a high-resolution USB camera, user-friendly fluidic interconnects
               and miniaturized 3D-printed interface was developed. To evaluate
               performance of the new chip-based system, median lethal
               concentrations (LC50) of a panel of reference toxicants obtained
               on this system were compared with those from tests using
               conventional static protocols, and were not significantly
               different. Automated behavioral tests were then conducted by
               perfusing toxicants through the chip-based device to dynamically
               assess the effect of toxicants on selected locomotory parameters.
               Results showed that the system was able to detect and
               automatically analyse data to assess changes in the swimming
               behavior of A.compressa at toxicant concentrations that did not
               induce mortality in test populations. For the majority of
               chemical stressors tested, behavioral sub-lethal changes occurred
               early and in a concentration- and exposure time-dependent manner
               and could be recorded with no “observer” input. We postulate that
               integrated Lab-on-a-Chip systems can enable new avenues for
               “Early Warning” biomonitoring systems that can automate the use
               of sensitive behavioral indices to rapidly detect presence of
               toxicants in aquifers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",

              including crystalline polyester",
  author   = "Suzuki, M and Murata, S and Mizuhata, H and Sata, S",
  abstract = "In the full color laser printers and copiers, the performance
              features of high print speed, fine image quality and environmental
              friendliness are required. Therefore the special toner also has
              been required for high speed printing and fine image quality.
              Recently many chemically prepared toners (CPTs) have been
              proposed, and these toners are suitable to achieve small and
              narrow particle size distribution. But most of these toners use
              styrene acrylic resin, and only a few toners use polyester which
              is superior to styrene acrylic resin in low-energy fusing. But due
              to the use of organic solvents in the manufacturing process,
              environmental friendliness remains a matter for improvement in
              polyester CPTs. We reported a novel PES CPT without using any
              solvent in the manufacturing process at NIP27 and NIP28. In this
              study, three technologies for advanced PES CPT were described. 1)
              To develop polyester chemically prepared toner which has larger
              fusing latitudes for full color printers, we developed a
              technology to cross-link polyester with oxazoline polymer. 2) To
              develop eco-friendly polyester chemically prepared toner for
              low-energy fusing, we tried to introduce crystalline polyester by
              emulsification in aqueous phase. It was found that crystalline
              polyester could be emulsified successfully in the presence of
              amorphous polyester which makes crystalline part soluble with
              amorphous part. 3) We have found it is possible to make a toner
              having coreshell structure in which the core contains crystalline
              polyester for low-temperature fusing and the shell uses seed
              polymerization of styrene for storage stability. In this seed
              polymerization process, styrene monomer was reacted and
              cross-linked with the polyester of surface of the toner particles.
              The shell made by seed polymerization is suitable to be insoluble
              with polyester core. From this study, we could obtain a toner
              having core-shell structure in which the core contained
              crystalline polyester and the shell contained amorphous polyester
              cross-linked by styrene. Furthermore, the toner provided improved
              performance in storage stability and low-temperature fusing.

              Tencel. THe cellulose is dissolved without undergoing any chemical

               In the automotive industry, one of the ways to achieve that is a
               reduction of the support structure weight. The solution that was
               derived from aerospace industry is monocoque support structure.
               Nevertheless, proper design of such structure is challenging,
               expensive, especially in unit production and hard to repair or
               modify in case of new subassemblies. An alternative solution for
               vehicle lightweight support structure is spatial frame created
               from carbon fibre reinforced composite tubes. A problem of such
               structure, in case of laminate composite materials, are the tubes
               connections. In classical aluminium spatial frame connections are
               welded, and therefore their strength is close to the material
               strength. In case of carbon fibre, such connections are usually
               created using adhesives, connecting carbon fibre reinforced tubes
               with composite shaped connectors or by precise cutting of the
               ends of tubes in order to increase area of contact between
               interfaces, applying adhesive and bounding tubes using composite
               materials. Another considered solution is carbon fibre tubes
               reinforced with 3D printed ribbing. Both analysis and
               optimization were conducted using HyperWorks software. The paper

              climate change and obesity, is there beginning to be the
              realisation that the physical environment is an important
              determinant of health. The paper uses a particular model of this
              relationship based on eco-system and health determinants theories
              to structure the review of evidence. The review covers: lifestyle
              choices in relation to physical activity and diet, mental
              well-being and community, the local economy and income, health
              inequalities and strategic land use transport planning, pollution
              and urban form, and finally impacts on global ecology. There is
              now a growing consensus that while personal factors are critical
              in determining health, the urban environment exacerbates or
              mitigates health and well-being outcomes. The level of active
              travel (walking and cycling) and outdoor recreational activity is
              strongly affected by accessibility to local facilities. Access to
              green, natural environments, and to local social networks, are
              factors in mental well-being. The wider sub-regional pattern of
              housing, economic development, land use and transport is a
              determinant of social exclusion and therefore health inequalities.
              It also affects health-damaging pollution, adaptability in the
              face of climate change and the level of carbon dioxide emissions.
              We have literally been building unhealthy conditions into many of
              our towns and cities. But comparisons with the best cities in
              Europe indicate that it is possible to reverse the less desirable
              trends. Success depends, however, on more radical policies of
              local authority control over land and finance than any political
              party has yet advocated. It also requires collaboration between
              the full range of powerful public and private organizations that
              influence the built environment. Future research is likely to
              further strengthen these conclusions. It will become much more
              obvious that planning for health and well-being is not only the
              NHS, but about creating a health-promoting physical, social and
              economic environment. © 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of

               sustainability of the global environment in addition to
               minimization of production cost. The digital eco-factory has been
               proposed for a simultaneous examination of environmental
               performance, productivity and manufacturability. This paper
               entertains how to construct the digital eco-factory with high
               accuracy and usability. In general, the digital eco-factory is
               constructed on the virtual production line modelling an actual
               production line and its components. A multi-agent based
               construction of the digital eco-factory was applied and a trial
               digital eco-factory has been implemented for a PCA (Printed
               Circuit Assembly) line. A PCA line consists of a solder paste
               printer, two or three electronic part mounters, reflow soldering
               oven and testing machine. In the PCA line, processes for the
               above machines proceed in sequence, these machines' capabilities
               are modelled as individual machine agents. There are several
               types of printed boards produced, depending on the number of
               mounted electronic components and the temperature of the solder.
               When a blank PCB (Printed Circuit Board) is input to a solder
               paste printing machine, the production process is started. A PCB
               is modelled as a part agent which is one of the product agents.
               For some example virtual productions, power consumption of each
               machine on each line from the environmental view and productivity
               of each machine and each line are monitored. From the results of
               the trial implementation, it can be said that all components on
               the production line could be configured as software agents with
               required accuracy. These agents are called ``machine agents.'' In
               addition to machine agents, manufactured products such as
               workpiece and parts are also configured as software agents. ©

               performed on fresh earth samples to find the optimum water
               content in sisal fiber-reinforced earth stabilized with OPC.
               Afterward, the effect of the addition of OPC on the hardening
               process was evaluated through shear vane and Vicat needle tests
               from 0 to 180 min after mixing. The results indicate that water

              especially in large domains where business goals require
              streamlined procedures. High-end print management systems offer
              integrated credit reception and efficient, parametrized accounting
              for the use of resources. The usage of printers and photocopy
              machines is controlled and monitored, and, through the latter,
              waste elimination is achieved. Print management inherently
              conforms with the rationale and mentality of green and
              eco-friendly technologies that also relate with the ethos of the
              open source movement in IT. One would expect that open source
              print management solutions would thrive; however, the vast
              majority of integrated management systems are commercial. There is
              only a small number of valuable open source print accounting
              solutions, but there are none that integrate accounting with a
              form of credit reception. This paper presents the design of an
              open system that integrates the provision of automated credit

              solution that fully automates the business process of print

              credit reception so that it can be realized without any human
              intervention, to plan the integration with a suitable open print

               The printed fibrous membranes possess a biphasic drug release
               profile in simulated intestinal fluid with a burst release within
               the first 12 h and a slower sustained release up to 72 h. The

  abstract = "Plastic cards are widely used in various industries all over the
              world. Many on-demand non-embossed pictured cards require
              overcoating (also referred to as laminating) processes for surface
              protection from fading, abrasion, alteration and counterfeiting.
              There are several lamination types, such as wet lamination, dry
              lamination, hot-melt lamination and extrusion lamination. The
              focus on this paper is the hot-melt lamination type which utilizes
              heat and pressure to adhere the film on the card. The laminating /
              overcoating layer material can be clear material with
              anti-abrasion capability or hologram material for authentication.
              Typical overcoating process in the thermal transfer card printer
              is done by thermal printhead or heat roller. This paper suggests
              the heating head for this process. The heating head works on a
              very similar principle as the thermal printhead. The heating
              resistive element and temperature sensing element are placed on
              the alumina head substrate. When power is applied, the resistive
              element generates heat for the overcoating material to thermally
              adhere to the plastic card surface. Unlike the thermal printhead,
              however, which has hundreds of tiny heating elements, the heating
              head has one contiguous heating element. The construction of the
              heating head gives more robust thermal performance and even
              heating capability across the overcoating material on the card
              surface. In comparison to a heat roller, the heating head can be
              used on-demand and does not require the constant pre-heating while
              the unit is on stand-by (more ``eco-friendly'' efficiency and
              safety). ©2012 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",

               polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films was developed using a
               laser printer and a xenon flashlight at room temperature under
               ambient air conditions by imprinting a pattern onto the PET
               films. A black square pattern was laser-printed onto various
               thicknesses of PET films and subjected to flashes of different
               powers. Using black colored patterns and a certain thickness of
               PET film, the black ink created a void in the PET film in the
               form of the set pattern. To understand this phenomenon, we
               measured the light absorbance spectrum of the xenon flashlight
               using a one-millisecond sampling rate of UV-vis spectrometer.
               Furthermore, Red-Green-Blue (RGB) compositions of the printed
               colors, such as yellow, red, green, blue, and black, were
               extracted using an image color extraction tool. By investigating
               the degree of light absorbed by the PET film, the absorbance
               score was defined by combining the percentage of light intensity
               with the wavelength of the light and the proportion of each color
               in the RGB compositions. A complex star pattern and a mask for

  abstract  = "Sustainability is a consideration of resource utilization without
               depletion or adverse environmental impact. In manufacturing,
               important sustainability issues include energy consumption, waste
               generation, water usage and the environmental impact of the
               manufactured part in service. This paper deals with three aspects
               of sustainability as it applies to additive manufacturing. First
               is a review of the research needs for energy and sustainability
               as applied to additive manufacturing based on the 2009 Roadmap
               for Additive Manufacturing Workshop. The second part is an energy
               assessment for selective laser sintering (SLS) of polymers. Using
               polyamide powder in a 3D Systems Vanguard HiQ Sinterstation,
               energy loss during a build was measured due to the chamber
               heaters, the roller mechanism, the piston elevators and the
               laser. This accounted for 95\% of the total energy consumption.
               An overall energy assessment was accomplished using
               eco-indicators. The last topic is electrochemical deposition of
               porous SLS non-polymeric preforms. The goal is to reduce energy
               consumption in SLS of non-polymeric materials. The approach was
               to mix a transient binder with the material, to create an SLS
               green part, to convert the binder, and then to remove the open,
               connected porosity and to densify the part by chemical deposition
               at room temperature within the pore network. The model system was
               silicon carbide powder mixed with a phenolic transient binder
               coupled with electrolytic deposition of nickel. Deposition was
               facilitated by inserting a conductive graphite cathode in the
               part center to draw the positive nickel ions through the
               interconnected porous network and to deposit them on the pore

  abstract  = "The development of genetically modified (GM) insect-resistant
               crops has aroused great public concern about the risks on the
               eco-environment resulting from a release of toxic Cry proteins
               (such as Cry1Ab) to the soil. Therefore, it is of crucial
               importance to measure the Cry proteins level and the GM crops
               content. Here, we have tested for the first time a method that
               uses novel carbon nanospheres (CNPs) label-free
               electrochemiluminescent (ECL) immunosensor for the ultrasensitive
               quantification of Cry1Ab and GM crops. In this work, novel CNPs
               were prepared from printer toner with a very facile approach, and
               linked with anti-Cry1Ab antibodies to modify a golden working
               electrode. The immunoreaction between Cry1Ab and its antibody
               formed an immunocomplex on the bioreceptor region of the sensor,
               which inhibited electron transfer between the electrode surface
               and the ECL substance, leading to a decrease of ECL response.
               Under the optimal conditions, the fabricated label-free ECL
               immunosensor determined Cry1Ab down to 3.0 pg mL−1 within a
               linear range of 0.010−1.0 ng mL−1, showing significant
               improvement of sensitivity than that of most previous reports.
               Meanwhile, the proposed method was successfully applied for GM
               rice BT63 and GM maize MON810 detections down to 0.010\% and
               0.020\%, respectively. Due to its outstanding advantages such as
               high sensitivity, ideal selectivity, simple fabrication, rapid
               detection, and low cost, the developed method can be considered
               as a powerful and pioneering tool for GM crops detection. Its use
               can also be extended to other toxin protein sensing in foods. ©

              Most ancillaries are controlled centrally from a press console and
              they should be easy to use and maintainable and cost effective.
              Technotrans has developed alpha.f dampening filtration system,

              chemistry due to reduced hazardous waste disposal. Quality,
              predictability, ease of use, cost and time savings are the
              important aspects of ancillaries. Legislation is also important
              for ancillaries, as tightening regulation on chemistry waste
              encourage sales of eco.clean filtration system, particularly among
              large printers. Printers need to know that the supplier they work

              water-based systems contain 60\%-70\% water, which gives the
              impression that they are safe and leads to the assumption that the
              remaining 30\%-40\% solids content is not subject to local and/or
              federal rules concerning disposal and safe handling. It required
              that water-based inks be handled in much the same manner as
              platisol inks. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must accompany
              all shipments and be available to any printer who uses the

              from stand-alone products to networked appliances. Variable data
              and/or image can be printed in high quality at high speed with
              ease of use. The networked MFP accessible or operated by anyone,
              anywhere, and at anytime will move into the main stream in the
              office. Based on technical predictions of print quality, box cost,
              running cost, reliability, speed, and eco-friendliness for office
              copiers and printers, let's discuss whether electrophotography

               produced by Gram-negative bacteria, are typical signaling
               molecules in quorum sensing (QS) systems. Importantly, AHLs play
               a key role in determining the virulence of foodborne pathogens
               and reflect the activity of spoilage bacteria. In this study, an
               eco-friendly fluorescence-sensing platform for the rapid and
               sensitive detection of AHLs was developed and characterized.
               Molecularly imprinted polymers embedded with yellow-emitting
               carbon quantum dots (CQDs) were obtained via the sol-gel process
               using furanone as an alternative template molecule, and
               long-wave-emitting CQDs with excellent optical properties were
               used as signal conversion materials. After template elution, the
               blotting cavities on the surface of the CQD@MIPs (molecularly
               imprinted polymers) were able to selectively recognize AHLs,
               demonstrating a stronger fluorescence response compared with the
               corresponding CQD@NIPs (non-imprinted polymers). Under optimal
               test conditions, a good linear relationship between the
               concentration of analyte and the relative fluorescence intensity
               of the CQD@MIPs was observed. The linear detection range was
               0–2.0 μM, and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.067 μM.
               Importantly, the proposed sensing platform functioned as an
               optical detection strategy that responded quickly (2 min) to
               AHLs. Additionally, this sensing platform was applied to the
               analysis of AHLs in bacterial supernatant samples with
               satisfactory results. More interestingly, the 3D-printing
               CQD@MIPs were tentative explored in this work, which was
               personalized and portable, has an advantage of point of care
               testing (POCT) detection in the future. Based on these results,
               this detection strategy has demonstrated substantial potential

               In the present paper, a form finding for a cement based
               tessellated pierced vault is studied. The multi-body rope
               approach (MRA) was used to define compression-only vault optimal

               and the definition of different tessellation meshes of the
               surfaces, according to different hole pattern configuration.
               Different piercing percentage of the vaults were considered and
               compared for the best solution identification. In addition, the
               geometrical solutions were analyzed by means of global stability

               concept of sustainable manufacturing has emerged to address this
               scarcity and to minimise environmental degradation. 3D printing
               also known as additive manufacturing, could potentially reduce
               material wastage, energy consumption and resulting emissions. A
               'techno-eco-efficiency' framework was developed to produce
               technically, economically, and environmentally feasible
               centrifugal pump impellers 3D printed using the fused filament
               fabrication process. Firstly, surface properties, geometric
               properties, build material properties, static structural and
               dynamic properties, and the hydraulic performance of impellers
               were assessed in order to investigate how process parameters,
               such as infill pattern, infill rate and reinforcement material
               affect the technical performance. Secondly, the eco-efficiency
               performance of technically suitable impellers was assessed using
               environmental life cycle assessment, life cycle costing tools and
               portfolio analysis. Thus, this 'techno-eco-efficiency' framework
               was used to achieve sustainable manufacturing and could act as a
               decision support tool for selecting cost-competitive,
               environmentally benign, and technically feasible products.
               Alternatively, it would assist product designers and
               manufacturers to minimise a trade-off between technical and
               resulting eco-efficiency performance. Copyright © 2021

               which cannot meet the green and sustainable development needs of
               modern building materials. Geopolymer is an environmentally

               have low environmental load and energy consumption, which is
               expected to become a substitute for OPC. However, geopolymers

               performance improvement, potential new applicationw and
               sustainability assessment of geopolymer materials. Discussion
               from this paper showed that the properties of geopolymer

               etc., can be significantly improved by some methods such as

               standard and monitored in term of deformations by the Digital
               Image Correlation techniques (DIC) in order to evaluate the

               In addition, using the HBPr and the results coming from the

               risks associated with their degradation. Hence, a strong interest
               in biodegradable polymers of natural origin has been increasing,
               for finding alternative materials with adequate mechanical
               properties for geotechnical and geo-environmental applications.
               The main aim of this study is to test a bio-based, biodegradable
               and eco-compatible polymer, able to replace polypropylene and
               other synthetic materials in the production of geosynthetics. For
               this purpose, Poly(lactic acid) or PLA, one of the most common
               bioplastic polymer material commonly used as filament for 3D
               printers, was investigated. The chemical structure of PLA was
               determined by 1H NMR and the optical purity determination by
               polarimetry. PLA filament was used to print samples of uniaxial
               and biaxial geogrid at 1:5 scale using a professional 3D printer.
               Subsequently, tensile tests were performed on the filament and on
               prototype geogrids. Tensile tests measured a maximum tensile
               resistance of 51.96 MPa for the filament and 12.96 kN/m for
               uniaxial geogrid prototypes. The mechanical properties of PLA
               were found to be comparable to petroleum derivatives. These
               results are encouraging and can support the utilization of PLA
               for innovative biodegradable geosynthetics production, which
               could represent an alternative to non-biodegradable products,

               damage accelerated chloride ingress in RAC. Incorporating RA
               increased the steel corrosion risk and shortened the initial
               corrosion time of reinforced RAC, and the cracking pattern of
               reinforced RAC was different from the cracking pattern of
               reinforced natural aggregate concrete. Removing and enhancing the
               adhered old mortar of RA improve the properties of RAC, and
               various modification methods can be employed to improve the
               resistance to chloride ingress and steel corrosion in RAC. In
               particular, a CO2-curing treatment, which is eco-friendly, is
               recommended for improving the RA and RAC properties. The study of
               chloride ingress and steel corrosion in ultra-high performance
               RAC and 3D-printed RAC should be a focus in further studies. ©

               (3D printing) technology for realizing printed circuit

               PCB manufacturing using 3D printing technology for aerospace
               applications, a comparative study is performed realizing a

               of metals is the high geometric flexibility of the processes and
               its ability to produce pilot or small batch series. In contrast,
               resource and energy intensities are often not considered as
               constraints, even though the turnout of additive manufacturing is
               high, at least compared to chip removing processes. The study at
               hand analyses the material characteristics and environmental
               impacts of a hose nozzle as an example of a commercial product of
               simple geometry. The production routes turning (conventional
               manufacturing) and laser beam melting (additive manufacturing)
               are compared to each other in terms of natural resource use,
               climate change potential and primary energy demand. It is found,
               that the product shows a lower demand for natural resources when
               produced via AM, but higher carbon emissions and energy demand
               when using a steel, that is mainly (80\%) produced from
               high-alloyed steel scrap. However, different case studies during
               the sensitivity analyses showed that a number of factors highly
               influence the results: the steel source as well as the source of
               electricity play a major role in determining the environmental
               performance of the production routes. The authors also found that
               other production processes (here cold forging of tubes) might be
               an eco-friendly alternative to both routes, if feasible from an
               economic point of view. In regard to the material
               characteristics, experimental testing revealed that the material
               advantages of AM produced hose nozzles (in particular higher
               yield strength) are reduced after a solution heat treatment is
               applied to the as-produced material, in order to increase
               corrosion resistance. However, products that do not require this
               production step might benefit from the higher yield strength, as
               a lower wall thickness could be realised. © 2019",

               manufacturing process for low to medium production volumes, rapid
               manufacturing becomes an increasingly relevant manufacturing
               approach. However, regulations and customers demand more
               eco-efficient life-cycles of products. This requires engineers
               and designers to pre-select between productive AM processes like
               selective laser sintering (SLS) and multi-jet fusion (MJF), based
               on their expected environmental impact in series production. As
               SLS already debuted in the mid-1980s, researches broadly explored
               parts' mechanical properties, energy and resource use. The
               multi-jet fusion (MJF) technology, introduced in 2017, delivers
               comparable part properties at considerably higher print speeds.
               However, its energy and resource use is still scarcely covered.
               To close this gap, this publication develops a model for
               evaluation of energy and resource utilization based on a case
               study with an automotive exterior series part using an EOS P396
               SLS and a HP 4200 MJF machine. Data from measurements in energy
               and material consumption as well as the print job shows a good
               predictability and builds the basis for an environmental
               assessment. The derived model and its functional blocks allow
               estimation and comparison of sustainability for different use
               cases in rapid manufacturing with MJF and SLS. Despite the
               process similarities, results concerning greenhouse gas emissions
               and cumulative energy demand are different. The gained insights
               enhance pre-selection of manufacturing strategies, a suitable
               printing technology and the evaluation of AM processes during
               manufacturing according to sustainability aspects. Printer
               manufacturers and users may find this research insightful for
               improvements in sustainability and comparability of future AM

               alternative processes have been proposed to replace them. The
               major requirement for such an alternative process is that it does
               not require a mask, it must be capable of being processed at room

               electrophoretic deposition is a promising process that has
               various advantages, but it needs nanoscale movement of the
               reaction cell. In this study, a disposable nanoactuator was
               designed and manufactured to utilize the photo electrophoretic
               deposition process. In designing the nanoactuator, it is possible

               Incorporating underutilised solids and/or waste solids as
               aggregates is a way of gaining the maximum environmental and
               economic benefits from the emerging 3D concrete printing
               technology. In this study, desert sand (small size),
               river-sediment ceramsite sand (medium size), and recycled
               concrete (large size) were experimentally investigated for use as
               aggregates in the 3D printing of concrete. Three mixtures were
               designed with continuous, open, and interrupted gradations of
               solids, respectively, based on the theory of particle
               interference, and aiming to meet the requirements of
               extrusion-based 3D printing. The influences of the particle
               grading characteristics on the printability-related early-age
               behaviours, mechanical properties, and shrinkage resistance have
               been measured and analysed. The test results demonstrate that the
               self-supporting skeletal effect formed by the gradated particles
               reduces the flowability of the mixtures, but the structural
               build-up/buildability performance is improved (under the premise
               of the desired printability). The interlayer distribution and
               skeleton of the gradated aggregate contribute to improving the
               interfacial interlocking effect and contact bonding between
               layers; this is visually validated through computed tomography
               (CT) scanning. Further, the addition of aggregates reduces the
               proportion of cementitious composites, and therefore effectively
               mitigates the shrinkage of the cement matrix. The grading
               characteristics of the underutilised particle resources are
               crucial for regulating the early-age 3D printability. This
               article provides feasible solutions based on experimental data
               for promoting the eco-utilisation of underutilised and waste
               solids in 3D printing, and these solutions satisfy the minimum

               are most commonly caused by severe traumas such as those caused

               hand is proposed to replace a functionality and/or appearance of
               the missing body part. The developed design of the prosthetic
               hand is based on the anatomy of a human hand. The dimensions and
               link length ratio which were taken for designing the proposed
               prosthetic hand is referenced from a biological human hand. The
               given joint angles ensure the maximum degree of freedom of the
               prosthetic hand. The joint between two links is a two-point
               contact joint, which significantly reduces the chances of fatigue
               and failure of the hand. The actuation of the distal, proximal

               is made using ECO-ABS with six rows of 19 parallel channels of
               square cross-sections. The permittivity of the ECO-ABS was
               measured at 2.55 with a loss tangent of 0.053. A conductor is
               placed at the back of the dielectric. The squared channels are
               filled with either distilled water or air. The effective
               permittivity within the reflector changes according to the
               material used to fill the channels. As an incident wave
               propagates through the printed dielectric, the configuration of
               air–water channels shapes the exiting phase front of the wave by
               locally controlling its phase delay. The resulting phase profile
               created by the air–water configuration leads to a steered beam.

               the optimum shearing temperature, shearing time and shearing rate

               degradation rate of PCL-based filaments by the introduction of
               microcrystalline cellulose into the polymer matrix. The enzymatic
               degradation of the composite and pure PCL materials were compared
               in terms of mass loss, mechanical properties, morphology and
               infrared spectra. The results showed an increased degradation
               rate of the composite material due to the presence of the filler
               (enhanced interaction with the enzymes). Additionally, a new
               numerical method for the prediction of the degraded geometry was
               developed. The method, based on the Monte Carlo Method in an

               efficiency by eliminating the concept of waste and leading to a
               shift away from the linear take-make-waste model. In a CE,
               resources are flowing in a circular manner either in a biocycle
               (biomass) or technocycle (inorganic materials). While early
               studies indicate that 3D printing (3DP) holds substantial promise
               for sustainability and the creation of a CE, there is no
               guarantee that it will do so. There is great uncertainty
               regarding whether the current trajectory of 3DP adoption is
               creating more circular material flows or if it is leading to an
               alternative scenario in which less eco-efficient localised
               production, demands for customised goods, and a higher rate of
               product obsolescence combine to bring about increased resource
               consumption. It is critical that CE principles are embedded into
               the new manufacturing system before the adoption of 3DP reaches a
               critical inflection point in which negative practices become

               barriers for 3DP to achieve a CE. We explore the two following
               overarching questions to discover what specific issues they
               entail: (1) How can a more distributed manufacturing system based
               on 3DP create a circular economy of closed-loop material flows?
               (2) What are the barriers to a circular 3D printing economy? We
               specifically examine six areas—design, supply chains, information
               flows, entrepreneurship, business models and education—with the
               aim of formulating a research agenda to enable 3DP to reach its

               properties of plasticized blends were then determined by the
               tensile test of 3D printed test samples (dogbones), as well as
               filaments. Measured elongation at break rapidly enhanced from
               21\% for neat non-plasticized PHB/PLA blends (reference) to 328\%
               for best plasticized blends in the form of filament, and from 5\%
               (reference) to 187\% for plasticized blends in the form of
               printed dogbones. The plasticizing effect on blends was confirmed
               by Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The study of
               morphology was performed by the Scanning Electron Microscopy.
               Significant problem of plasticized blends used to be also
               plasticizer migration, therefore the diffusion of plasticizers
               from the blends after 15 days of exposition to 110 °C in the
               drying oven was investigated as their measured weight loss.
               Almost all of the used plasticizers showed meaningful positive
               softening effects, but the diffusion of plasticizers at 110 °C
               exposition was quite extensive. The determination of the degree

               work in parallel with humans, making the tasks easier for them.
               Industries are frequently introducing robots on the factory floor

               motivating robot manufacturers to work out solutions where return

               is the most important part of a robot for making specific
               operations. The end effector market has also grown and brought
               innovation in the area of grasping objects with different shapes

               emerging class of devices with high potential for
               electrochemistry. Nevertheless, as-printed electrodes provide
               poor conductivity due to the presence of high amounts of
               insulating thermoplastic material, requiring surface
               post-treatments to enhance their electrochemical performance.
               Such treatments often employ non-eco-friendly, costly, and
               time-consuming protocols. In this regard, we propose, for the
               first time, a sub-minute (around 50 s) and reagentless surface
               treatment of carbon-black/PLA-based 3D-printed electrodes using a
               Photo-Thermal approach by a CO2 laser. After the proposed
               treatment (optimized conditions: the power of 6.2\%, the scan
               rate of 20 mm s−1, and height of 10 mm), a marked improvement in
               the electrochemical electrode response (current increase and
               peak-to-peak separation) was achieved towards the detection of
               catechol, ascorbic and uric acids, paracetamol,
               hexaammineruthenium(III) chloride, and Ferri/ferrocyanide redox
               couple. The enhanced simultaneous determination of Cd2+, Pb2+,
               and Cu2+ was also demonstrated. As a proof-of-concept, the
               quantification of the adulterant paracetamol in a real seized
               cocaine sample was performed using a fully 3D-printed
               electrochemical system, and a good recovery value of 97.8\% was
               acquired. To explain all the improved results, the electrode was
               carefully characterized by imaging, spectroscopic and
               electrochemical techniques. Additionally, the between-measurement
               \% relative standard deviation (\%RSD) was 6.8\% (n = 12), while
               the between-device \%RSD was 7.5\% (n = 6) at the 1 µmol L-1
               paracetamol, indicating adequate manufacturing reproducibility.
               Thus, the strategies developed here open up new possibilities for
               applications of carbon-based 3D-printed electrodes in analytical

               printing, spray and electrospinning were synthetized and tested
               for the first time. The Mg2Si fine powders were obtained through
               the combination of ball milling and thermal annealing under Ar
               atmosphere. While the latter process was crucial for obtaining
               the desired Mg2Si phase, the ball milling was indispensable for
               homogenizing and reducing the grain size of the powders. The
               synthetized Mg2Si powders exhibited a large Seebeck coefficient
               of 487 µV/K and were blended with a polymeric solution in
               different mass ratios to adjust the paste viscosity to the
               different requirements of 3D printing, electrospinning and

               techniques that unequivocally prove their viability for producing
               thermoelectric parts and components. These can certainly trigger
               further research and development in green thermoelectric
               generators (TEGs) capable of adopting any form or shape with
               enhanced thermoelectric properties. These green TEGs are meant to
               compete with common toxic materials such as Bi2Te3, PbTe and CoSb
               that have Seebeck coefficients in the range of 290–700 μV/K,
               similar to that of the produced Mg2Si powders and lower than that
               of 3D printed bulk Mg2Si pieces, measured to be 4866 μV/K. Also,
               their measured thermal conductivities proved to be significantly
               lower ( 0.2 W/mK) than that reported for Mg2Si (≥ 4 W/mK).
               However, it is herein demonstrated that such thermoelectric
               properties are not stable over time. Pressureless sintering
               proved to be indispensable, but difficultly achievable by long
               thermal annealing (even above 32 h) in inert atmosphere at 400
               °C, at least for bulk Mg2Si pieces constituted by a mean grain
               size of 2–3 μm. Hence, for overcoming this sintering challenge
               and become the silicide’s extrusion viable in the production of
               bulk thermoelectric parts, alternative pressureless sintering
               methods will have to be further explored. © 2019, The Author(s).",

  abstract  = "Vegetation has been previously proposed as a method for
               protecting artificial and natural slopes against shallow
               landslides (e.g. as may be triggered by an earthquake); however,
               previous research has concentrated on individual root soil
               interaction during shear deformation rather than the global slope
               behaviour due to the extreme expense and difficulty involved in
               conducting full-scale field tests. Geotechnical centrifuge
               modelling offers an opportunity to investigate in detail the
               engineering performance of vegetated slopes, but its application
               has been restricted due to the lack of availability of suitable
               root analogues that can repeatably replicate appropriate
               mechanical properties (stiffness and strength) and realistic 3D
               geometry. This study employed 3D printing to develop a
               representative and repeatable 1:10 scale model of a tree root
               cluster (representing roots up to 1.5 m deep at prototype scale)
               that can be used within a geotechnical centrifuge to investigate
               the response of a vegetated slope subject to earthquake ground
               motion. The printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic
               root model was identified to be highly representative of the
               geometry and mechanical behaviour (stiffness and strength) of
               real woody root systems. A programme of large direct shear tests
               was also performed to evaluate the additional strength provided
               by the root analogues within soil that is slipping and
               investigate the influence of various characteristics (including
               root area ratio (RAR), soil confining effective stress and root
               morphology) on this reinforcing effect. Our results show that
               root reinforcement is not only a function of root mechanical
               properties but also depends on factors including surrounding
               effective confining stress (resulting in depth dependency even
               for the same RAR), depth of the slip plane and root morphology.
               When subject to shear loading in soil, the tap root appeared to
               structurally transfer load within the root system, including to
               smaller and deeper roots which subsequently broke or were pulled
               out. Finally, the root analogues were added to model slopes
               subjected to earthquake ground motion in the centrifuge, where it
               was revealed that vegetation can substantially reduce
               earthquake-induced slope deformation in the soil conditions
               tested (76\% reduction on crest permanent settlement during
               slippage). Both the realistic 3D geometry and highly simplified
               root morphologies, as characterised mechanically by the shear
               tests, were tested in the centrifuge which, despite exhibiting
               very different levels of additional strength in the shear tests,
               resulted in very similar responses of the slopes. This suggests
               that once a certain minimum level of reinforcement has been
               reached which will alter the deformation mechanism within the
               slope, further increases of root contribution (e.g. due to
               differences in root morphology) do not have a large further
               effect on improving slope stability. © 2017, The Author(s).",

               onto jute fabrics to print dog-bone tensile specimens (Type I
               specimen from ASTM D638). The jute fabrics were chemically
               modified, treated with flame retardant additives, and sprayed
               with aerosol adhesive to improve the mechanical properties of
               PLA/Jute fabric composites. The elastic modulus and the strength
               of PLA were higher than PLA composites, and the plastic
               deformation of the PLA composites was slightly lower than PLA.
               Tomography scans revealed the fabrics were well oriented and some
               adherence between jute fabrics and PLA. Viscoelastic properties
               of PLA composites resulted in the reduction in storage modulus

               demand to minimize environmental impact in all industrial
               sectors. Our aviation industry is also under this scrutiny. This

  abstract  = "Purpose: In the present scenario, the demand for additive
               manufacturing (AM) has increased. Taking into account
               environmental problems and sustainability, manufacturers are now
               also considering the environmental and sustainability criteria in
               their decision-making process. The sustainability concept is
               known as the triple-bottom line, namely, economic, social and
               environmental perspectives. Sustainable concept selection in the
               manufacturing organisation can be considered as the selection of
               sustainable material, product design, process, method and
               technology. This study aims to select an appropriate AM process
               by considering sustainability from various available techniques.
               Design/methodology/approach: Appropriate sustainable performance
               indicators for the AM were identified based on literature as well
               as in discussion with experts and decision-makers. The model
               addresses all the major dimensions of sustainable concepts of AM
               such as material/product quality, machine performance, market
               stability, total cost and ecological values. A hybrid
               multi-criteria decision-making approach, i.e. stepwise weight
               assessment ratio analysis and complex proportional assessment
               methods, have been used to select the best AM technique. While
               selecting criteria affecting AM machines and processes, criteria
               based on the sustainable concept are considered. Findings: Among
               the four selected AM processes, i.e. fused diffusion modelling
               (FDM), laminated object manufacturing (LOM), stereolithography
               apparatus (SLA) and selective laser sintering (SLS), the best
               alternative was found to be FDM. Research
               limitations/implications: The present study highlights some
               limitations in the selection of AM process and methodology used
               in this research. This study considers only four AM processes,
               i.e. FDM, LOM, SLA and SLS. Future work may include considering
               other AM processes and criteria that affect the sustainability of
               AM. Practical implications: The present work will help
               researchers and production managers to decide the best AM
               alternatives to fabricate desired parts. Hence, AM can help in
               maximum energy utilisation, optimal consumption of resources,
               minimum material wastage and reduction of CO2 emission.
               Originality/value: The study considers some important criteria,
               including energy consumption, eco-friendly and wastage-free
               production, that help sustainable AM. This study can result in a
               good economic efficiency of AM industries and, therefore,
               positively impact customers using green products. © 2022, Emerald

               conversion of small molecules in the production of chemical
               feedstocks and renewable fuels. The flexibility in complex and
               custom design that additive fabrication offers is potentially
               revolutionary. Numerous rapid prototyping materials and devices
               have been developed in recent years, making it timely to
               scrutinize the gaps between lab-based systems and ideal,
               industrially relevant electrocatalytic materials and devices. In
               this perspective, we define the scope of benefit of 3D printing,
               its potential, limitations, and current trends of development for
               electrocatalytic applications. We analyze future prospective
               electrodes in terms of size, printing resolution, and cost. We
               examine the strategies employed in post-processing of 3D-printed
               electrodes and in the fabrication of electrocatalytically based
               prototyping devices. We also offer our perspective on how rapid
               prototyping technology may shape the future development of

               general. © 2019 Elsevier Inc. The application of advanced
               manufacturing techniques such as additive manufacturing, or 3D

               an attractive, eco-friendly route to rapidly evolve production
               designs without the need to retool a manufacturing facility. This
               rapid prototyping approach offers promise in accelerating product
               development as well as facilitating fabrication of novel
               structures for fundamental studies in electrocatalytic
               applications. Unlike the direct impact of 3D printing in some
               other applications, the highly interdisciplinary and complex
               nature of materials, chemistry, and catalytic interfaces along
               with the scale required for electrocatalysis (and low demand for
               bespoke designs) means an extended period of research and
               development is needed to realize the full potential and scope of
               benefit of 3D printing in electrocatalysis. We envision that in
               the near term, following advances in printing technologies and
               greater understanding of properties of these printed materials,
               large-scale devices will incorporate 3D-printed components in
               concert with parts produced by more traditional means. It will,

               biodiversity and of fishery resources in the marine environment.
               An artificial reef (AR) could be a tool for protecting or
               restoring these habitats and their declining biodiversity, and
               also help to enhance sustainable fisheries. The goal is to design
               non-polluting structures that best mimic the complexity of
               natural habitats in order to improve their service to the
               community. To date, the assessment of reef performance has been
               mostly focused on fish assemblages and species of ecological
               and/or socio-economic interest, and has disregarded the biofilm
               communities that determine the first level of an AR's trophic
               network. In this work, we used biofilm formation to compare the
               quality of substrates used as building parts for an AR, in order
               to optimize an eco-friendly material that will be used to design
               a new generation of ARs produced by giant 3D printers. The
               structure of the photosynthetic communities has been identified
               using pigment biomarkers and their production of exudates has
               been analysed. These polymeric substances were quantified in
               terms of total sugar and protein concentrations. They were
               further analysed in terms of amino acid content. We found no
               significant differences between the micro-algae communities
               developed on the different substrates. These photosynthetic
               communities were mainly composed of diatoms, prasinophytes,
               haptophytes, and dinoflagellates. However, we showed that the
               material for ARs is crucial for biofilm development, especially
               with regard to its secretions of sugar. The choice of an
               appropriate substrate for AR construction is thus of particular
               importance since biofilm secretions determine the organic
               substrate on which sessile macro-organisms will settle. © 2018

               attracted immense significance due to government policies and
               societal demand for environmental consciousness. However, to
               enhance the financial and ecological impact of the network, the
               forward and reverse supply chain networks must integrate well so
               that decisions taken in both areas complement each other. In this
               study, we propose an eco-efficient CLSC design for extending the
               existing supply chain of an Indian firm that assembles inkjet
               printers. The network design is configured as a multi-objective
               model in a multi-period setting and is mathematically formulated
               into a mixed integer programming problem with fuzzy objectives.
               Fuzziness provides flexibility to the decision makers because
               they must accommodate the conflicting nature of the objectives.
               The fuzzy multi-objective model incorporates the firm's economic
               and environmental concerns into the decision making process by
               selecting environmentally responsible suppliers to procure
               components based on sustainable criteria, choosing appropriate
               recovery options for end-of-use (EOU) inkjet printers, and
               planning an efficient transportation network design for reducing
               the carbon emission of the distribution and collection
               activities. The uniqueness of the proposed fuzzy CLSC
               optimization model lies in providing an integrated decision
               making framework that can aid the manufacturer in making crucial
               strategic, tactical, and operational decisions of optimal
               selection of suppliers, component order allocation, recovery flow
               allocation, and vehicle routing planning. The novelty of the
               model also lies in simultaneously minimising the overall cost of
               the activities undertaken, maximizing the performance of the
               component suppliers and minimising the carbon emissions of the
               associated transportation activities. A weighted fuzzy
               mathematical programming approach is utilised for generating a
               fuzzy, properly efficient solution as the desired compromised
               solution for the CLSC network problem configuration. The
               relevance of the model is justified using a real data set derived
               from a case study of the firm based in the northern capital
               region (NCR) of India. The findings indicate that the proposed
               integrated CLSC network model enables the firm in gaining
               sustainably from the numerous electronic product reuse
               opportunities in the Indian market. Further, while costly to
               begin with, choosing suppliers with higher sustainable
               performance and vehicles with lesser emission rate could
               substantially enhance firm's sustainable image and result in
               higher profits in the future. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

               substrates, three different types of materials were used.
               Materials were different in respect of fabric weight and thread
               count, while material composition was the same for all three
               materials. The appropriate test card consisting of fields of CMYK
               colours was printed, varying the number of ink layers applied.
               Samples were exposed to heat treatment after printing. The heat
               applied was measured by thermovision camera. Spectrophotometric

               Information and Communication Technologies. The last decade, in
               particular, has seen profound awareness on the part of
               individuals as well as organizations in being environmentally
               aware. While automation and related computing activities continue
               to lead to exponential use of energy quotient, at the same time,
               Green ICT continues to chip away at the 'resigned' views of the
               decision makers to environmental responsibilities. ICT operates
               at systems level, applications level, at the end-user level
               through the desktops and printers, and at the enterprise level
               through its data centers, servers and other infrastructure. Green

              devices and has a significant positive ecological impact. Existing
              toner saving approaches have two main drawbacks: appearance of
              hardcopy in toner saving mode is worse in comparison with normal
              mode; processing of whole rendered page bitmap requires
              significant computational costs. We propose to add small holes of
              various shapes and sizes to random places inside a character
              bitmap stored in font cache. Such random perforation scheme is
              based on processing pipeline in RIP of standard printer languages
              Postscript and PCL. Processing of text characters only, and
              moreover, processing of each character for given font and size
              alone, is an extremely fast procedure. The approach does not
              deteriorate halftoned bitmap and business graphics and provide
              toner saving for typical office documents up to 15-20\%. Rate of
              toner saving is adjustable. Alteration of resulted characters'
              appearance is almost indistinguishable in comparison with solid
              black text due to random placement of small holes inside the
              character regions. The suggested method automatically skips small
              fonts to preserve its quality. Readability of text processed by
              proposed method is fine. OCR programs process that scanned

               patterns to a Cloud-server where the data are transformed into
               time-series and then processed to obtain the appliances’

               The category ``light production'' is the mainstream of recent

               improvement to higher speed range for heavy duty use with low

               help us to improve these factors. To prepare a model to help
               predict the implementation of the GSCM, a questionnaire was
               prepared to affect the current scenario in general. The model was
               developed following a survey consisting of responses from key
               elements of the supply chain management hierarchy. Most important
               variables included technology, policies and the average length of
               the supply chain as well as some interaction effects. Using this
               model, GSCM processes can be easily implemented on a scale of
               1-5, 1–very difficult and 5–very easy. This research was

  abstract  = "Silk fibroin (SF) is a natural protein polymer that can be
               extracted from B. mori silkworm cocoons. It has been used by the
               textile industry for thousands of years. With increasing needs
               for implantable and degradable biomaterials, SF textile material
               has attracted more and more interests in the biomedical field,
               due to its excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability,
               non-immunogenicity and sufficient supply. Moreover, it can be
               combined with other biomaterials to form biopolymer composites
               with unique performance. The versatility and sustainability of SF
               fibers-based biomedical textile material provides new research
               ideas and solutions for tailoring biomaterials to meet specific
               biomedical applications via eco-friendly approaches. The natural
               SF fiber can be obtained by degumming the cocoons, and after
               being dissolved, the regenerated SF solution can be obtained.
               Then, the regenerated SF solution can further prepare the
               regenerated SF fiber by different molding methods. According to
               the practical application requirements in the field of
               biomedicine, SF fibers can be made into one-dimensional,
               two-dimensional or three-dimensional biomedical textiles by
               various techniques such as weaving, knitting, non-woven,
               electrospinning and three-dimensional printing technology, which
               have broad application prospects in biomedical fields such as
               tissue engineering, drug delivery and biosensors. However, there
               are still some disadvantages in the mechanical properties and
               persistence of SF textile materials, beyond that the specific
               biofunctionality is not excellent such as blood solubility, cell
               adhesion, osseointegration and cell differentiation. Therefore,
               the application of silk fibroin textile materials in the
               biomedical field is limited to some extent. In order to expand
               the application of SF textile materials in the biomedical field,
               it is usually necessary to enhance the inherent function or
               introduce new functions of SF textile materials through
               functional modification while retaining its intrinsic properties.
               At present, there are four main methods for functional
               modification of SF materials, including intrinsic functional
               modification, surface modification of SF fiber, blending
               modification with other functional fiber, directly mixing before
               regenerated SF solution spinning. The functionally modified SF
               materials can effectively guide cell response and functional
               expression, enhance mechanical properties, and achieve the
               purpose of promoting wound healing and tissue organ repair. This
               paper mainly reviews the recent advances in the development of
               one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three-dimensional SF-based
               textile materials in the biomedical fields. And the structure and
               basic properties of SF materials are introduced, the functional
               modification methods of SF-based textile materials are
               summarized. Besides, the future development tendency of SF-based
               textile materials is also forecasted. © 2020, Materials Review

               data disclose that in the 1980s, 400-800 watts per square metre
               was typical; during the heyday of the dotcoms, it was 750-1000

               academics. We had contributions from some of the bestknown
               experts in this growing field. Part I of this book, with three
               chapters, was devoted to strategic decisions facing firms
               regarding the secondary market for its products: whether to
               pursue remanufacturing, leasing versus selling, the impact of
               take-back legislation, and guidelines for product design for
               CLSCs. Part II, with four chapters, was devoted to more tactical
               issues, once the decision to “close the loop” has been made.
               Issues explored include network design (for collection,
               consolidation, and reprocessing centers), used-product
               acquisition, grading and disposition, production planning for
               remanufactured products, and marketing issues for remanufactured
               products-pricing, positioning, and warranties. Part III was
               devoted to case studies: one chapter was devoted to the motion
               picture industry, one chapter to eco-efficiency initiatives in
               hospitals, and one chapter to the discussion of practices in
               retreaded tires, computers and printers, printer cartridges, and

               interdisciplinary nature of CLSC research, including a chapter
               summarizing empirical findings, and another chapter summarizing
               case studies presented at a recent workshop, as well as how CLSC

               electronics/electrical items, manufacturing scrap, discarded
               constructional materials, polymers from daily needs, etc., is
               being generated day-by-day, whereas its treatment is lagging. The
               term zero waste (ZW) is continuously encouraging both producers
               and consumers to adopt sustainable approaches in order to reduce
               their expenditures as well as to help in making a better world.
               In the past, researchers have highlighted numerous techniques to
               tackle physical waste, however the chemicals which are normally
               generated from this waste is more critical and limitedly

               for future of manufacturing by which the burning issue of “Waste”
               can be tackled. However, ZWM can be supported with recycling and
               reusability of the produced wastes in another manufacturing

               have extracted it from the Salento quarries for use as an
               ornamental, celebrative or building material. The production
               chain of this stone, from extraction through to the finished

               and muddy form. In recent decades a new attitude toward stone
               scraps has gradually taken hold, namely an eco-design approach.
               Already adopted by some companies, it consists of reusing
               industrial scraps to produce innovative manufacturing products.
               Nowadays, in fact, only a small percentage of Lecce Stone (LS)
               scraps is recycled and used as raw material in other fields,
               while a significant portion is taken to the landfill, as in the
               case of the scraps produced in laboratories by Apulian artisans.

               in various industrial fields because it facilitates effective and
               customizable fabrication of complex structures. An important
               processing route for 3D printing is the extrusion of inks in the
               form of colloidal suspensions or emulsions, which has recently
               attracted considerable attention because it allows for selection
               of a wide range of printing materials and is operable under
               ambient processing conditions. Herein, we investigate the 3D
               printability of complex fluids containing chlorella microalgae as
               an eco-friendly material for 3D printing. Two possible ink types
               are considered: aqueous chlorella suspensions and emulsions of
               oil and water mixtures. While the aqueous chlorella suspensions
               at high particle loading display the 3D-printable rheological
               properties such as high yield stress and good shape retention,
               the final structures after extruding and drying the suspensions
               under ambient conditions show a significant number of macroscopic
               defects, limiting their practical application. In contrast, the
               3D structures produced from the oil-in-water Pickering emulsions
               stabilized by chlorella microalgae, which are amphiphilic and
               active at the oil–water interface, show significantly reduced
               defect formation. Addition of a fast-evaporable oil phase,
               hexane, is crucial in the mechanisms of enhanced cementation
               between the individual microalgae via increased inter-particle
               packing, capillary attraction, and hydrophobic interaction.
               Furthermore, addition of solid paraffin wax, which is crystalline
               but well-soluble in the hydrocarbon oil phase under ambient
               conditions, completely eliminates the undesirable defect
               formation via enhanced inter-particle binding, while maintaining
               the overall rheological properties of the emulsion. The optimal
               formulation of the Pickering emulsion is finally employed to
               produce a 3D scaffold of satisfactory structural integrity,
               suggesting that the chlorella-based ink, in the form of an
               emulsion, has potential as an eco-friendly 3D printing ink

              this evolution and increasing additive diversity are the demand
              for high speed office printers and commercial digital presses and
              the need for low priced laser printers to make small office and

              development of toner with low fusing temperatures (low T g) based
              on environmentally safe raw materials. Novel fumed

               printing technology has been studied. The empirical study focuses
               on the effect of the use of 3D printing technology on the
               building supply chain, aimed primarily at manufacturing companies
               in construction, but including suppliers, architects and

               provides several improvements in manufacturing performance, such
               as a shortening of lead times, integration of functions and
               allowing for reduced material usage, therefore possibly turning

               consumption, and improve workmanship. The 3D-printed concrete
               technology (3DPCT), more broadly recognized as the design of a 3D
               object via a computer-aided design (CAD) model or a digital 3D
               model, has accelerated considerable progress in these areas in
               other industries. Although 3DPCT has advanced remarkably in
               recent years, producing an appropriate 3D printing material that
               improves performance while reducing material consumption, which
               is really important for CO2 reduction, is urgently needed. The
               present 3DPCT faces many obstacles, one of which is the limited
               range of printable concretes. To tackle this limitation,
               extensive studies on developing creative approaches for
               formulating alkali-activated materials (AAMs) for 3DPCT for
               modern building applications have been conducted. AAMs are
               maintainable substitutive binders to ordinary Portland cement.
               Therefore, the need to undertake a comprehensive literature
               review on the current status of AAM performance on 3D-printable
               concretes for building applications is substantial. This article
               comprehensively reviews the quality requirements, advantages,
               disadvantages, common techniques, delivery, and placement of
               3DCP. This literature also delivers indepth reviews on the
               behaviors and the properties of AAM-based concrete composites
               used in 3D-printed construction. Moreover, research trends are
               moving toward a wide-ranging understanding concerning the
               economic benefits and the environmental footprints of 3DCP for
               building applications with AAMs as suitable concrete materials
               for the emerging robust eco-friendly concrete composite for
               digital construction constructions nowadays. Given the merits of
               the study, several hotspot research topics for future
               investigations are also provided for facilitating the wide use of
               3DPCT in real applications to address rapidly the gap between

              lots of information on the Internet raised the amount of copier
              and printer devices. Therefore more and more paper is used for the
              daily routine. The manuscript copying, the document and electronic
              mail printing have became very easy tasks. The prices of the
              copiers and printers decrease and all components for the devices
              are less expensive. But the costs of the copying continually
              increase because of the increasing claims. We have to think of how
              can we produce the funds for the growing amount of paper. We must
              look for such a solution that reduces the using of paper. It
              follows that this is cost effectiveness. And there is an other
              favourable factor. Using less paper is an eco-friendly solution
              and this is very important in our days. In this paper the Copy
              Management System will be described what was elaborated in
              KD-INTEG-06-SCM-2006 project. This system contains hardware and

               of new processes (such 3D printing) and materials (such as
               renewably sourced resins). To enable a fast transition to
               high-quality, sustainable plastic applications, a specific
               methodology could be a key competitive advantage. This novel
               methodology is focused on improving the objectivity and
               efficiency of plastic production and the design review process.
               It is applicable to discrete optimization events in any product
               lifecycle milestone, from concept design to serial production
               stages. The methodology includes a natural way to capture
               plastic-related knowledge and trends, oriented towards building a
               dynamic “interaction matrix”, with a list of potential
               optimizations and their positive or negative impacts in a
               comprehensive set of multi-criteria evaluations. With an
               innovative approach, the matrix allows the possibility to
               incorporate a business strategy, which could be different at
               every lifecycle stage. The business strategy is translated from
               the common “verbal” definition into a quantitative set of “Target
               and Restrictions”, making it possible to detect and prioritize
               the best potential design optimization changes according to the
               strategy. This methodology helps to model and compare design
               alternatives, verify impacts in every evaluation criteria, and
               make robust and objective information-based decisions. The
               application of the methodology in real cases of plastic material
               design optimization in the automotive industry has provided
               remarkable results, accelerating the detection of improvement
               methods aligned with the strategy and maximizing the improvement
               in product competitiveness and sustainability. In comparison with
               the simultaneous application of existing mono-criteria
               optimization methodologies (such as “Design to Cost” or “Eco
               Design”) and subjective expert-based reviews, the novel
               methodology has a reduced workload and risks, confirming its
               potential for future application and further development in other

               and lignin) has attracted increasing attention by using this
               abundant, sustainable, and ecofriendly material. While cellulose
               can be easily tailored into a highly viscous ink for 3D printing,
               after solvent evaporation, the final printed structures become
               highly porous, fragile, and easily fall apart in water due to its
               hydrophilic nature. Lignin, another crucial component of natural
               lignocellulose, has not yet been reported for ink printing due to
               its unfavorable rheological behavior. Herein, a low-cost direct
               ink printing strategy is developed to fabricate lignin-based 3D
               structures with lignin no further refined and a more compact
               microstructure as well as different functionalities compared with
               printed cellulose. By using a soft triblock copolymer as the
               crosslinking agent, the rheology of lignin-based inks can be
               adjusted from soft to rigid, and even enables vertical printing
               which requires stiff and self-supporting features. The
               lignin-based inks contain less water (≈40 wt\%) and exhibit a
               much denser, stiffer structure, resulting in a wet tensile
               strength of ≈30 MPa, compared to only ≈0.6 MPa for printed
               cellulose. In addition, the unique macromolecular structure of
               lignin also demonstrates significantly improved stability in
               water and under heat, as well as UV-blocking performance. © 2020

               could represent a valid option to ameliorate PPE shortages.
               Methodology: Custom-made face mask were designed on the basis of
               facial scan and then 3D-printed. The whole protocol is executed
               with freeware software and only required a 3D printer. Six

               technology with higher resource efficiency and better ecological
               benefits in production systems. However, recent works have shown
               that the ecological benefits of AM are sensitive to the
               parameters in operation. If the parameters are not designed
               appropriately, the ecological performance of AM can be worse than
               conventional manufacturing processes. To ensure the ecological
               benefits of AM, eco-design based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
               is a promising approach to analyze and minimize the environmental
               impacts of AM. However, LCA can only be carried out at the later
               stage of the design process after most design and decision
               operations are already made because the implementation of LCA
               requires detailed process and inventory information of the entire
               life cycle. If users attempt to optimize the ecological
               performance of their design solutions, they need to repeat almost
               the entire design process. To solve this problem, this work
               suggests using energy performance assessment to replace LCA in
               eco-design for AM. The proposed approach uses a holistic
               framework consisting of three parts: a simulation tool for energy
               consumption prediction of AM, an assessment model for energy
               performance of AM, and general workflows of eco-design for AM.
               Since the energy performance quantification and assessment of AM
               require less process information, it can be integrated earlier
               and easier into the eco-design for AM. Additionally, an example
               of use case is provided that confirms the feasibility of this
               framework. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

               (3D)-architectured electrodes encompassed with cobalt-rich
               tungsten carbide (Co-WC) as an electrocatalyst using a

               3D-architectured Co-WC electrodes with an average particle size

               cement contents are normally used due to process requirements. In
               this article, the application to layered extrusion of a recently
               developed low clinker cement containing 50\% Portland cement and
               50\% supplementary cementitious materials, such as limestone,

               compressive strength. Such a low clinker mortar can be
               successfully retarded, processed, pumped, and extruded just after
               mixing it in line with the accelerator paste. This accelerated
               mortar formulation contains only 303 kg/m3 of Portland cement,
               which is roughly half the amount used in current accelerated

               it is usually difficult to use traditional processing methods to
               realize customized 3D designate structures. Herein, the fused
               deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing technique is developed to
               architect four customized 3D PVDF PEHs, and the relationship
               between the designed structures and corresponding piezoelectric
               output performances are systematically studied by theoretical
               simulation. The results show that, with a decreased force-bearing

               direction increases, resulting in an excellent piezoelectric

               There is a need to study the environmental sustainability of

               a scalable and eco-friendly solution to sensing and energy
               harvesting applications. Piezoelectric polymers such as PVDF are
               particularly interesting because of the possibility to engineer
               the performance of these materials through addition of
               higher-performance piezoelectric inclusions and nanomaterials and
               to scalably manufacture such composites by emerging techniques
               such as 3D printing. This work makes two contributions, namely
               towards composite design and towards development of accurate
               effective property models. In the context of composite design, we
               evaluate the piezoelectric performance of PVDF modified by the
               addition of polycrystalline-BaTiO3 and multiwalled carbon
               nanotubes. Firstly, the addition of BaTiO3 dramatically improves
               the electric field within the composite offering significant
               advantages specially at low BaTiO3 concentrations. Secondly, the
               addition of carbon nanotubes to the matrix, particularly at
               higher BaTiO3 loadings, leads to an order of magnitude increase
               in the piezoelectric flux generation. Further enhancement in the
               flux generation is also possible by tuning the polycrystallinity
               of the BaTiO3 inclusions. However, these behaviours are
               inclusion-driven and the piezoelectric behaviour of the matrix
               does not contribute to this improvement. Importantly, a small
               addition of BaTiO3 and CNT into the PVDF matrix, away from
               percolation, can simultaneously improve flux and electric field
               generation. In this part of the work, we assume an isotropic PVDF
               matrix. Given that PVDF is elastically anisotropic, the second
               aspect of this work is the development of an effective property
               model for CNT-modified PVDF, taking into account the elastic
               anisotropy of poled PVDF, to predict the elastic coefficients of
               CNT-modified PVDF matrices, thus undertaking a key step towards
               modelling anisotropic piezoelectric composites. We show that the
               anisotropy-based model makes similar predictions in the effective
               composite behaviour, indicating that in the case of PVDF-based
               piezocomposites, the anisotropy of the matrix does not
               significantly affect the piezoresponse. © 2019 IOP Publishing

               architecture, arts and design, food, and construction.
               Transitioning from the visualization and prototyping stages into
               functional and actual part replacement opens further design
               possibilities. Among the diverse applications of AM, construction

               widely used product in the market. Nevertheless, it has been a
               subject of interest to researchers in recent decades. There are
               evident challenges and risks for the integration of AM towards
               large-scale construction. Therefore, progress in their
               commercialization seems to proceed at a slow pace, as only a few
               3DP trials for large-scale construction can be found in the

               However, the relatively restricted range of 3D printable
               biocomposites decelerated its adoption in the biomedical sector
               as a conventional manufacturing technique. In this method, the
               introduction of biofillers with unique properties to produce high
               performance composites as printing feedstocks are increasingly
               recommended. The interest in using eco-friendly fillers from

               low-cost poly(lactic acid) (PLA) composites is recently
               increased. In this work, a series of PLA biocomposites filled
               with calcined seashell (CSh) particles have been prepared by melt
               mixing technique using a twin-screw extruder, and characterized

               fillers within the biopolymeric matrix, which was responsible for
               the enhancement of the various mechanical properties. Where, by
               adding 10 wt\% of treated CSh, the tensile modulus and strength
               were significantly increased from 183.8 ± 4.7 MPa and 29.81 ± 1.8
               MPa to 241.9 ± 63 MPa and 49.06 ± 8.87 MPa, respectively,
               compared to the virgin PLA. In addition, respected to PLA matrix,
               the compressive moduli of the printed specimens of PLA/5CSh and
               PLA/10CSh biocomposite filaments exhibited improvements of 5\%

               marked improvement in the thermal stability of the elaborated

               field of biomedicine. However, the unmatched biomechanics and
               poor bioactivities of conventional Ti implants usually lead to
               insufficient osseointegration. To tackle these challenges, it is
               critical to develop a novel Ti implant that meets the bioadaptive
               requirements for load-bearing critical bone defects. Notably,
               three-dimensional (3D)-printed Ti implants mimic the
               microstructure and mechanical properties of natural bones.
               Additionally, eco-friendly techniques based on inorganic-binding
               peptides have been applied to modify Ti surfaces. Herein, in our
               study, Ti surfaces were modified to reinforce osseointegration
               using chimeric peptides constructed by connecting W9, RP1P, and
               minTBP-1 directly or via (GP)4, respectively. PR1P is derived
               from the extracellular VEGF-binding domain of prominin-1, which
               increases the expression of VEGF and promotes the binding of VEGF
               to endothelial cells, thereby accelerating angiogenesis. W9
               induces osteoblast differentiation in bone marrow mesenchymal
               stem cells and human mesenchymal stem cells to promote bone
               formation. Overall, chimeric peptides promote osseointegration by
               promoting angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Additionally, chimeric
               peptides with P3\&4 were more effective than those with P1\&2 in
               improving osseointegration, which might be ascribed to the
               capacity of P3\&4 to provide a greater range for chimeric
               peptides to express their activity. This work successfully used

               resulting from typical remotely operated vehicles (ROVs)
               currently used. Soft robots consist of elastomeric materials,
               compliant actuators, sensors and other supporting structures,
               which enable them to be used for numerous applications due to
               their flexibility, light weight, low noise, and many degrees of
               freedom. Mechanical actuators, such as pneumatic actuators and
               servomotors, introduce design constraints related to their size,
               weight, and cost. Moreover, vibration and noise are undesired
               attributes that preclude the use of robots developed with such
               technologies and might disturb the test environment. This paper
               presents a robust design of a jellyfish-like robot with eight
               bell segments, named KryptoJelly. The presented robot can perform
               multidirectional swimming by NiTi shape memory alloys (SMA)
               actuators confined in a conduit and activated by electrical
               current stimulation. KryptoJelly is constructed from a 3D printed
               rigid structure and a soft silicone bell that closely mimics the
               biological locomotion and appearance of a jellyfish found in
               nature; the Chrysaora colorata species. Four 127 μm diameter SMA
               wires (of mass 14 mg each) were used per channel to deform the
               silicone bell margin. The robot can operate up to 1608 cycles
               continuously for 1.5 h underwater at high power input (3 times
               higher than the standard) and sustain its own total body mass of
               650 g (∼6000 times the weight of the actuators used). KryptoJelly
               is able to maneuver in both vertical and horizontal directions
               during bell contraction-expansion cycles. A study on the effect
               of multistage-power-time input sequence of NiTi SMA actuators and
               bell design, which results in swimming, is presented. This work

               HDPE and subsequently extruded in filament to be used for 3D
               printing. Cenosphere/HDPE blends are studied for melt flow index
               (MFI) and rheological properties. MFI decreases with cenospheres
               addition. Complex viscosity, storage and loss modulus increase
               with filler loading. DSC results on the filament and printed

               field, South China, whose ore veins are mainly hosted in the
               Dayishan pluton. LA–ICP–MS zircon U–Pb dating for the medium-fine
               grained- and medium-coarse grained-biotite monzogranite of
               Dayishan pluton yields emplacement ages of 154.5 ± 1.6 Ma (MSWD =

               consistent with the muscovite 40Ar-39Ar plateau age of 150.4 ±
               0.9 Ma for the quartz vein type ore veins. It is indicated that
               the Sn mineralization in the Wujiaping deposit is related to the
               Late Jurassic granitic magmatism. These granites show the
               geochemical features of highly fractionated S-type granite: 1)
               low Zr + Nb + Ce + Y contents (1.1); 3) low crystallization
               temperature (mean = 688 °C); 4) high Rb/Sr ratios (mostly > 48);
               5) high differentiation index (DI > 90); and 6) low CaO, P2O5,
               Sr, and Eu contents. Whole rocks isotopes show that these
               granites shows variable initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios
               (0.70251–0.71208), negative εNd(t) values (−7.94–5.62) and old
               two stage Nd model ages of 1491–1563 Ma. LA–MC–ICP–MS zircon
               Lu–Hf isotopes show that the medium-fine-grained monzogranite
               have positive εHf(t) values of 0.37–8.5 and two stage Hf model
               ages of 662–1180 Ma, whereas the medium-coarse grained-biotite

               stage Hf model ages of 1431–1599 Ma. It is proposed of that these

               BLE standards and can communicate with off-the-shelf radios
               compliant to those standards. SC μ M exclusively uses on-chip
               oscillators, including a 2.4-GHz LC oscillator to synthesize the
               communication frequency, and a 2-MHz RC oscillator to clock the
               chip rate. The challenge is that the LC oscillator drifts at 2100
               ppm over a temperature range of 45 °C, far from the 40-ppm
               maximum drift mandated by the IEEE802.15.4 standard. While
               one-shot calibration is possible, any temperature change causes

               nanocomposite film is proposed as a sensitive layer to meat
               quality monitoring in the present work. The incorporation of
               anthocyanin (ATH) on gelatin-ZnO (G-ZnO) film induced a
               sensitivity improvement of films towards ammonia vapor according
               to impedance measurements. G-ZnO-ATH film presented a good
               response (38.69 \%) to the presence of ammonia vapor at 300 ppm.
               Also, good selectivity for ammonia was observed in the films.
               G-ZnO-ATH, applied to minced meat's quality monitoring at
               different storage conditions, showed a good performance, with a
               significant (p < 0.05) non-linear Spearman correlation between

               materials with low working temperature is urgent to fabricate

               mesoporous layer modified multi-layer TiO2/SnO2 nanocomposite
               thin film for improving sensitivity and selectivity of detecting
               ethanol at a low temperature. The Pt mesoporous layer is prepared
               by simple sputtering techniques, which are completely compatible
               with the MEMS process. The characterization results show the Pt
               sputtering time of 30 s and the annealing temperature of 500℃ are
               the opening condition and forming condition of Pt mesoporous
               layer, respectively, which has the most mesoporous of 5–50 nm.
               Because the Pt mesoporous layer has copious mesoporous and there
               is an abundant Schottky barrier between Pt and TiO2, the thin
               film (optimal parameters: 30 s, 500℃) based sensor has the
               highest sensitivity to ethanol at 130 ℃ and its response is as
               high as 3.32 to 0.1 ppm of ethanol, so the thin film is regarded

               on the multi-layer TiO2/SnO2 nanocomposite thin film prepared by
               sputtering techniques is a simple but effective method to largely

               catalysts via simple hydrothermal technique, and investigate the
               effect of copper oxide phases on the application of interest.
               These catalysts are applied towards dual application namely
               4-nitrophenol (4-NP) conversion and electrochemical hydrogen
               evolution reaction (HER). Due to the difference in mechanism of
               these both applications, we pick up two best catalysts for either
               application. We explore these differences through intensive
               characterizations such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray
               photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature-programmed
               reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR) analysis. XRD reveals the presence
               of varying copper oxide phases across all the synthesized
               catalysts. XPS discovers the disparities between catalysts
               annealed at various temperatures. Reducibility of catalysts is
               studied via H2-TPR since they can disclose phase conversions
               taking place in the material thereby directly affecting the
               application. Cu-Cu2O (150℃) could convert 98.6 \% of 50 ppm 4-NP

               sensing properties. It exhibited a response (Ra/Rg) of 28.3–100
               ppm H2 at the temperature of 230 °C and the detection limit is
               30.2 ppb. Meanwhile, it also showed a good selectivity and
               long-term stability to H2. The H2 sensing mechanism is attributed
               to the synergistic effect between ZnO (0001) signal crystal
               facets and ZnO/Zn2SnO4 heterojunction structures which enhanced
               the gas reactivity and resistance modulation range. On the
               contrary, insufficient annealing restricts the film crystallinity
               and the growth of hexagonal ZnO while undue annealing destroys
               the compactness of the films, leading to poor H2 sensing
               properties. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",

               produced water lies at the heart of petroleum industry, various
               membranes have been developed to address this challenge. Given
               the salient features of high thermal and chemical stabilities,
               ceramic membranes possess huge potential for recovering potable
               water from produced water. A new CDC/PA@Ceramic membrane
               (carbide-derived carbon/polyamide on Al2O3 ceramic support) was
               fabricated by depositing carbide derived carbon (CDC) on alumina
               support through two phases of interfacial polymerization using
               piperazine and 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid crosslinked through
               terephthaloyl chloride. The merits of the fabricated membrane
               were thoroughly characterized by several characterization

               efficiency was >98\% with a feed concentration of 67.5 ppm of
               oil/water emulsion. The highest pure water permeate flux reached
               250 L/m2.h at 4 bar. The long-term stability test showed that the
               CDC/PA@Ceramic membrane remained stable for elongated time of 720
               min with constant separation efficiency of >96\% and permeate
               flux of 58 L/m2.h at 2 bars. All results were validated by visual
               inspection, fluorescence spectrophotometry and optical microscopy
               of the feed and permeate throughout the membrane performance
               tests. The CDC/PA@Ceramic membrane can be a potential candidate

               was analyzed by Liquid Chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry

               of 100\% field capacity irrigation without silicon and
               inoculation (3.15 and 6.64 mg.g−1 dry biomass, respectively). As
               minimum amino acids were almost observed in treatments that were
               not achieved silicon and mycorrhiza, so results of this study
               showed that silicon at 300 ppm and licorice root inoculation by

               Owing to the keto-enol tautomerism and rotation of methyl group
               around C4–C13 single bond, six structures (S1–S6) were

               B3LYP, ωB97XD and mPW1PW91 with basis sets up to 6–311+G(2d,p).
               In addition, 1H/13C NMR chemical shifts (δ, ppm) were estimated

               and crystal (Co2+:ZnS) was controlled to be 0.0042 in the
               emission spectral range of Co2+ to minimize the scattering
               effect. An ultrabroadband mid-infrared emission of 2–4 μm was
               observed at room temperature in the samples after excitation by
               using a commercially available laser diode of 1550 nm. The
               significant changes in the lifetime and fluorescence intensity of
               Co2+:ZnS-doped chalcogenide glass were measured in the
               temperature range of 90–290 K. A resolution of approximately 0.18
               K was observed when used as a temperature detector. Furthermore,
               a gas-sensing device was built by using the strong and broad
               emissions of the sample, and the detection sensitivity of butane
               reached 56 ppm. These results show that this glass-ceramics can
               be used as optical sensing of gas and temperature. © 2021

               concentrations of toxic gases is a major challenge when using
               semiconductor metal oxide (SMO) gas sensors in complicated
               real-world environments. In this study, by strategically
               combining a three-dimensional inverse opal (3DIO) macroporous ZnO
               substrate and a ZIF-8 outer filter membrane, two series of
               sensors with Pt NPs loaded at different locations are developed.
               In the optimal 3DIO ZnO@ZIF-8/Pt sensor, the existence of small
               Pt NPs in ZIF-8 cavities can effectively accelerate the
               absorption of H2S, capture electrons from the N site of ZIF-8,
               and donate the electron to the S site of H2S, as indicated by
               density functional theory simulations, leading to a significantly
               increased response to H2S. Together with the molecular-sieving
               effect that ZIF-8 exerts on gas molecules with larger kinetic
               diameters, the 3DIO ZnO@ZIF-8/Pt sensor exhibits a high response
               to H2S (118–5.5 ppm), a detection limit of 40 ppb, and
               importantly, a 59-fold higher selectivity to H2S against typical
               interference gases. In addition, the 3DIO ZnO@ZIF-8/Pt sensor is
               developed as a multi-platform sensor to evaluate trace
               concentrations of H2S in meat quality assessment, halitosis

               environment and human health. However, the detection range of
               most NO2 sensors is ppm-level, and it is still challenging to

               tin diselenide nanoflakes decorated with 1D zinc oxide nanowires
               (SnSe2/ZnO) heterojunctions were first reported by facile
               hydrothermal and ultra-sonication methods. The response of the
               fabricated SnSe2/ZnO sensor enhances 3.41 times on average
               compared with that of pure SnSe2 sensor to 50–150 ppb NO2 with a
               high detection sensitivity (22.57 ppm-1) at room temperature. In
               addition, the SnSe2/ZnO sensor has complete recovery, negligible
               cross-sensitivity, and small relative standard deviation (6.98\%)
               during the 1 month sensing test, which can meet the requirements
               for NO2 detection in environmental monitoring. The enhanced NO2
               sensing performance can be attributed to the n-n heterojunction
               constructed between SnSe2 and ZnO. The as-prepared sensor based

               composition and micro-morphology of SnSe2, SnO2, and SnSe2/SnO2
               samples. At room temperature, the SnSe2/SnO2 composite film
               sensor had a higher response to 20 ppm NO2 gas when the mass
               ratio of SnSe2 and SnO2 was 1:2. A series of experiments were
               performed to investigate the NO2 sensing properties of this
               sensor. The results of gas-sensing tests indicated that the

               heterostructure between n-type SnSe2 and n-type SnO2
               nanomaterials, and at the same time, we proposed that

               titania with biofuel increased the performance qualities such as
               brake thermal efficiency (BTE), exhaust gas temperature (EGT),
               Torque and Power. Further this combination reduced the Greenhouse
               gas emissions such as CO, CO2, and UHC. The specific fuel
               consumption (SFC) was also reduced and proved to be the better
               alternative to existing fossil fuel. However, the emission of NOx
               was increased. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",

               concentrations in vehicles due to the high exposure which occurs
               in this setting. These studies have found using recirculate (RC)
               settings substantially reduces in-cabin traffic-related pollution
               concentrations but possibly leads to an adverse accumulation of
               carbon dioxide (CO2) from driver respiration. The aim of this
               study was to highlight how vehicle models and ventilation
               settings affect in-cabin concentrations to ultrafine particles
               (UFP) and CO2 in real-world conditions. We assessed the ability
               of different vehicles to balance reductions in UFP against the
               build-up of in-cabin CO2 concentrations by measuring these
               pollutants concurrently both inside and outside the vehicle to
               derive an in/out ratio. When ventilation settings were set to RC,
               UFP concentrations inside the vehicles (median: 3205 pt./cm3)
               were 86\% lower compared to outside air (OA) (23,496 pt./cm3)
               across a 30-min real-world driving route. However, CO2
               concentrations demonstrated a rapid linear increase under RC
               settings, at times exceeding 2500 ppm. These concentrations have
               previously been associated with decreased cognitive performance.
               Our study did not find an effect of gasoline fuelled vehicles
               affecting in-cabin UFP levels compared to hybrid or electric
               vehicles, suggesting that self-pollution was not an issue. We
               also found that certain vehicle models were better at reducing
               both in-cabin UFP and CO2 concentrations. The results suggest
               that under RC settings in/out CO2 ratios are largely determined
               by the leakiness of the vehicle cabin, whereas in/out UFP ratios
               are primarily determined by the efficacy of the in-built air
               filter in the vehicles ventilation system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",

               preventing food poisoning caused by biogenic amines or microbes.
               Therefore, various analytical techniques have been introduced to
               detect low concentrations of cadaverine (CV) and putrescine (PT),
               which are representative biogenic polyamines involved in food
               spoilage (5–8 ppm at the stage of initial decomposition after
               storage for 5 days at 5 °C and 17–186 ppm at the stage of
               advanced decomposition after storage for 7 days at 5 °C).
               Although previous methods showed selective CV and PT detection
               even at low concentrations, the use of these methods remains
               challenging in research areas that require in-situ, real-time,
               on-site monitoring. In this study, we demonstrated for the first
               time an in-situ high-performance chemical receptor-conjugated
               graphene electronic nose (CRGE-nose) whose limits of detection
               (LODs), 27.04 and 7.29 ppb, for CV and PT are up to 102 times
               more sensitive than those of conventional biogenic amine sensors.

               functional theory (DFT) calculations, and their interaction
               mechanism was characterized by a DFT 3D simulation.
               Interestingly, the CRGE-nose was connected on a micro sim chip

               Milkfish fry (Average Body Weight (ABW): 0.137 ± 0.004 g) were
               randomly distributed in 27 Fiber Reinforced Plastic (FRP) tanks
               with 20 fry per tank. The experiment was conducted with three
               levels of FWH supplementation (0, 20 and 40 ppm) and three levels
               of feed supplementation (0, 50 and 100\%). The FWH
               supplementation at 40 ppm significantly (p < 0.01) improved the
               average daily gain (ADG), total biomass gain and survival (\%) of
               C. chanos. Further, the FWH supplementation at 40 ppm with 50\%

               biomass gain in C. chanos compared with group received 100\% feed
               without FWH. The FWH supplementation significantly (p < 0.01)
               increased the microalgae diversity and abundance compared to
               other treatments and has positive correlation with the enhanced
               growth performances of fish. The gut microbial study showed that
               40 ppm of FWH significantly (p < 0.01) increased total bacterial
               load but inhibited Vibrio population. The FWH supplementation
               improved haematological parameters signifying better health

               supplemented with FWH and fed with 50\% feed also supported the
               effect of FWH on the enhancement of health status of C. chanos.
               It can be concluded that FWH supplementation at 40 ppm can save

               for trimethylamine (TMA) detection was designed by atomic layer

               membrane. Water flux of the modified PEI membrane is 126.9 ± 1.6
               L·m−2·h−1 (LMH) under 6 bar hydraulic pressure, which is 4.4
               times as high as the pristine PEI membrane (25.8 ± 0.3 LMH).
               Meanwhile, the MgCl2 rejections of both membranes are maintained
               >95\%. Nanofiltration performance of the QEDTP membrane is stable
               in 180 h continuous nanofiltration test at 6 bar pressure. The

               (Co-UMOFNs) were synthesized and blended into poly (ether block

               supports for the pervaporation of phenol aqueous solution. The
               membranes were characterized by XRD, ATR-IR, TGA, CA and SEM
               measurements. Effects of the Co-UMOFNs loading, feed temperature
               and feed concentration on phenol separation performance were
               investigated. The results showed that Co-UMOFNs have a
               two-dimensional layered morphology and have good compatibility
               with the PEBA. A “brick and mortar” architecture morphology was
               achieved after incorporating Co-UMOFNs into the PEBA membrane.
               The amorphous PE segments in the PEBA were turned into a
               crystalline structure, restricting the motion of PE segments. The
               filling of Co-UMOFNs slightly improved the thermal stability and
               hydrophobicity as well. With the increase of the Co-UMOFNs
               loading from 0\% to 40\%, the phenol separation factor increased
               from 27 to 45, and the total flux decreased from 1.2 kg m-2h-1 to
               0.42 kg m-2h-1, when separation of 1000 ppm phenol solution at 70
               °C. The interlayer galleries induced by the Co-UMOFNs stacking
               increased the tortuosity, and the crystalline structure of the

               Therefore the water flux was inhibited and the phenol separation

               studies identified a mixture of 2-methyl furan and 2, 5 dimethyl

               renewable gasoline fuel blends. Within the Co-Optima initiative,
               this furan mixture was used in the formulation of a custom
               renewable gasoline-like fuel, termed CB\#2, that contains 40\% of
               the furans in volume. Although CB\#2 has demonstrated better
               performance than regular E10 gasoline for advanced compression
               ignition and boosted spark ignition engines, several concerns
               arose regarding stability of furans. Stability can be improved by
               adding antioxidant additives, but the effect of furans’ stability
               and the antioxidants on the ignition and combustion
               characteristics of gasoline fuels is unknown. In the present

               unstabilized CB\#2 and CB\#2 stabilized using butylhydroxytoluene
               (added in a concentration of 250 ppm to the furan species). From
               the test result, both fuel batches showed the same octane rating.
               Moreover, homogeneous charge compression ignition engine
               experiments at naturally aspirated and lean conditions showed
               that the two batches have the same autoignition reactivity and

               range from 10′s of microns to up to a few cm in diameter and
               contain variable, but usually relatively low (several hundred ppb
               to a few ppm), quantities of U. Because Pb is a volatile element,
               it tends to be lost from the melts, so individual impact glasses
               can be dated by the U-Th-Pb isotopic systems. The presence of two
               additional Pb components in lunar glasses, likely linked to
               addition of lunar Pb to the beads during their residence on the
               lunar surface and from terrestrial laboratory contamination,
               require corrections to the data before accurate formation ages of
               the glasses can be determined. Here we report a U-Th-Pb isotopic
               and geochemical study of impact glasses from the Apollo 14 soil
               14163, which documents multiple impacts into chemically diverse
               targets that can be linked to the main groups of rocks found on
               the Moon, i.e., mare basalts, highlands plagioclase-rich rocks,
               and KREEP (from high contents of K, REE and P) enriched rocks.
               The impact ages show a bimodal distribution with peaks at
               ∼3500–3700 Ma and <1000 Ma, similar to that obtained previously
               by 40Ar-39Ar dating of other suites of lunar regolith glasses.
               Our data suggest two predominant age peaks at ∼100 Ma and ∼500
               Ma, with other statistically definable clusters of ages also
               possible. As Pb is relatively resistant to subsolidus diffusive
               loss in these glasses, the age clusters probably represent
               primary formation ages during impact events, although processes
               such as preferential preservation of young glasses and impact
               conditions necessary for production of regolith glasses need
               further quantification. © 2021 The Authors",

               as settling tanks and pipes for aeration or sludge transfer, are
               composed of austenitic stainless steel (EN 1.4307 or EN 1.4404)
               instead of galvanised or painted carbon steel to reduce the
               maintenance costs. The sensitivity to pitting and crevice
               corrosion of austenitic grades in certain WWTP environments has
               also led to the use of duplex grades. The purpose of this study
               is to evaluate the maintenance of piping systems (WWTPs) and its
               effect on their life cycle environmental impacts and costs (LCC)
               for both austenitic and duplex stainless steel grades. The final
               objective is to aid grade selection for piping in a WWTP
               environment. The considered functional unit (FU) is a complete
               piping system. Conventional austenitic stainless steel grades
               (e.g., EN 1.4404) are studied alongside duplex ones (e.g., EN
               1.4362 and EN 1.4462). The calculated environmental impacts are
               the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Primary Energy Demand
               (PED). The production, manufacturing, transport, use including
               maintenance activities, and end-of-life (burdens and credits)
               phases are included in the life cycle assessment (LCA). The
               maintenance activities consist of the required replacements of
               stainless steel piping during the lifespan of the WWTP. Thus, the
               service lives of the pipes included in the considered WWTP
               environment are determined based on long-term corrosion
               prediction models (power law), which predict the evolution of pit
               or crevice depth as a function of time. The model parameters are
               estimated based on own experimental results, supplemented by the
               existing literature. The corrosion rates determine the number and
               frequency of replacements, i.e., define the different scenarios
               of maintenance. The LCA, LCC and corrosion prediction models are
               then combined into a user-friendly tool, which can be used in
               industry for an appropriate grade selection for pipes in a WWTP
               environment. The tool includes several degrees of freedom such as
               piping distribution, water pressure, chloride content,
               replacement criteria, etc. The results show that using duplex
               stainless steel grade EN 1.4462 leads to lower GWP and PED at the
               end of the WWTP's service life of 40 years. This is mainly due to
               multiple replacements of the system's parts in wastewater with
               high levels of chloride (>3000 ppm) if more conventional
               austenitic stainless steel alloys such as EN 1.4404 are used.
               Leaner duplex stainless steel grades were also included in this
               LCC assessment. The duplex grade EN 1.4062 showed the lowest
               total LCC, thanks to its leaner chemical composition (i.e., lower
               nickel content) combined with good localized corrosion
               resistance. © 2021",

               presence of a collector, potassium amyl xanthate (PAX) and salt
               (NaCl). The results showed that the foaminess of the frothers
               responded to the presence of PAX differently, from a marked
               decrease to a notable increase at certain frother concentrations.
               Additionally, the foaminess of PAX/frother in terms of PAX
               concentration was examined and it was found that the foaming
               capacity of the mixture levelled off at low PAX concentrations
               (1–5 ppm), suggesting that only a small amount of PAX in the
               liquid could notably promote the foaminess of frothers. It was
               also found that the presence of PAX had a greater impact on the
               foaminess of DPM than it did on MIBC and DPG. Interestingly, the
               foaming ability of the tested frothers was reduced at high

               and PAX. These differences can be seen when compared to the

               was promoted in the ternary system, while an overall decrease for
               DPM was observed. A good agreement was also found between the

               Multi-array Average (RMA) procedure, which was primarily designed
               for analysing gene expression data from Affymetrix arrays. Given
               the abundance of Affymetrix microarrays and the popularity of the
               RMA method, it is crucially important that the normalization
               procedure is applied appropriately. In this study we carried out
               simulation experiments and also analysed real microarray data to
               investigate the suitability of RMA when it is applied to dataset
               with different groups of biological samples. From our
               experiments, we showed that RMA with QN does not preserve the
               biological signal included in each group, but rather it would mix
               the signals between the groups. We also showed that the Median
               Polish method in the summarization step of RMA has similar mixing
               effect. RMA is one of the most widely used methods in microarray
               data processing and has been applied to a vast volume of data in
               biomedical research. The problematic behaviour of this method
               suggests that previous studies employing RMA could have been
               misadvised or adversely affected. Therefore we think it is
               crucially important that the research community recognizes the
               issue and starts to address it. The two core elements of the RMA
               method, quantile normalization and Median Polish, both have the
               undesirable effects of mixing biological signals between
               different sample groups, which can be detrimental to drawing
               valid biological conclusions and to any subsequent analyses.
               Based on the evidence presented here and that in the literature,
               we recommend exercising caution when using RMA as a method of
               processing microarray gene expression data, particularly in

               level of miR-15a was obviously higher in Raji cells transferred
               with pre-miR-15a plasmid than in the blank group and in the
               negative control group. After Raji cells were transferred with
               the pre-miR-15a expression plasmid for 48 h, Bcl-2 protein
               expression levels were obviously decreased，which indicated that
               there was a significant difference as compared with the negative
               control group and blank group (P < 0.05). The CCK8 assay showed
               that transfection of pre-miR-15a expression plasmid decreased the
               cell growth at 24, 48 and 72 h post-transfection. After Raji
               cells were transferred with pre-miR-15a expression plasmid,
               apoptotic cells can be seen with Hoechst dyeing, and the cell
               apoptotic rate was obviously higher than that in blank group and
               negative control group. CONCLUSION Pre-miR-15a can induce
               apoptosis and inhibit the growth of Raji cells.",

               reference miRNAs were preselected in sequencing data of 90
               patients and ranked in a stability analysis by RefFinder. A
               selection of the most stable miRNAs was evaluated by geNorm and
               NormFinder analyses of RT-qPCR data of 29 patients. U6 small
               nuclear RNA (RNU6) was also included in the evaluation. MiR-9-5p
               and miR-210-3p expression was assessed by RT-qPCR in 45 and 65

               markers, HPV type, hypoxia status, suboptimal expression levels,
               and low stability. In RT-qPCR assays, the combination of
               miR-151-5p, miR-152-3p, and miR-423-3p was identified as the most
               stable normalization factor across clinical markers, HPV type,
               and hypoxia status. RNU6 showed poor stability. By applying the
               optimal reference miRNAs, higher miR-9-5p expression in HPV16-
               than HPV18-positive tumors and higher miR-210-3p expression in
               more hypoxic than less hypoxic tumors were found in accordance
               with the sequencing data. MiR-210-3p was associated with poor
               outcome by both sequencing and RT-qPCR assays. In conclusion,
               miR-151-5p, miR-152-3p, and miR-423-3p are suitable reference

               consistent feature of the hypoxic response in both normal and

               circulating factor in response to a hypoxic environment remains
               unknown. The current study aimed to examine the effect of a
               high-altitude hypoxic environment on circulating
               miR-210-3p.Methods: We examined and compared the levels of
               miR-210-3p using TaqMan-based qRT-PCR in both peripheral blood
               cells and plasma from 84 ethnic Chinese Tibetans residing at 3560
               m, 46 newly arrived migrant Han Chinese (Tibet Han) and 82 Han
               Chinese residing at 8.9 m (Nanjing Han). Furthermore, we analyzed
               the correlations of miR-210-3p with hematological indices.
               Results: The relative concentrations of miR-210-3p to internal
               reference U6 in blood cells were significantly higher in the
               Tibet Han group (1.01±0.11, P<0.001) and in the Tibetan group
               (1.17±0.09, P<0.001) than in the Nanjing Han group (0.51±0.04).
               The absolute concentrations of plasma miR-210-3p were also
               markedly elevated in the Tibet Han group (503.54±42.95 fmol/L,
               P=0.004) and in the Tibetan group (557.78±39.84 fmol/L, P<0.001)
               compared to the Nanjing Han group (358.39±16.16 fmol/L). However,
               in both blood cells and plasma, miR-210-3p levels were not
               significantly different between the Tibet Han group and the
               Tibetan group (P=0.280, P=0.620, respectively). Plasma miR-210-3p
               concentrations were positively correlated with miR-210-3p levels
               in blood cells (r=0.192, P=0.005). Furthermore, miR-210-3p levels
               in both blood cells and plasma showed strong positive
               correlations with red blood cell counts and hemoglobin and
               hematocrit values. Conclusion: These data demonstrated, for the
               first time, that miR-210-3p might act as a circulating factor in
               response to hypoxic environments and could be associated with

               orthognathic surgery were included. A composite skull model was
               reconstructed using data from spiral computed tomography scan and
               surface scanning of the dental arch. LeFort I osteotomy of the
               maxilla and bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy of the
               mandible were simulated using Dolphin Imaging 11.7 Premium.
               Genioplasty was performed if indicated. Virtual plan was then
               transferred to operation room using 3D-printed surgical
               templates. Frankfort horizontal plane (FHP), midfacial plane
               (perpendicular to the FHP through the nasion), and coronal plane
               (perpendicular to the FHP through the sella point) were the
               selected three symmetry planes.Midpoint of the contact of the
               maxillary and mandibular central incisors (UI, LI), and the
               mesio-buccal cusp of the first maxillary and mandibular molars
               (U6-R,U6-L, L6-R, L6-L) were the six chosen volumetric landmarks.
               To calculate the linear difference and overall mean linear
               difference (mean difference of the distance between UI, LI, U6-R,
               U6-L, L6-R, L6-L to FHP, midfacial and coronal plane) between
               simulated and postoperative models, the distance between selected
               landmarks and symmetry planes was measured. To calculate the
               angular difference and overall mean angular difference, values of
               the angles constructed by the occlusal, palatal, and mandibular
               plane to FHP and midfacial plane respectively were determined on
               simulated and postoperative models.Results The virtual surgical
               planning was successfully transferred to actual surgery with the
               help of 3D-printed surgical templates. All patients were
               satisfied with the postoperative facial profile and occlusion.
               The overall mean linear difference was 0.81 mm (0.71 mm for
               maxilla and 0.91 mm for mandible); and the overall mean angular
               difference was 0.95° (the mean angular difference relative to FHP
               was 1.10°, and that relative to midfacial plane was
               0.83°).Conclusion Virtual surgical planning facilitated the

               tumors. The RNAi technique is a method to inhibit gene expression
               economically, quickly, efficiently and specifically. This study
               used RNAi technique to explore the interfering effect of COX-2
               geneexpression and the influence on the malignant proliferation
               of A2 cells after quenching COX-2 in vitro . Methods Three COX-2
               siRNA expression vectors with human U6 promoter were constructed.
               The COX-2 siRNA vectors and the vacant vector (pEGFP) were
               transfected into A2 cells with lipofectamine respectively. The
               cell strains transfected were selected. The change of COX-2
               expression levels was examined by Western blot and RT-PCR. The
               effects on the proliferationof A2 cells after silencing COX-2
               were detected by cell growth curve and clonogenic assay in vitro

               plasmid were validated by PCR, restriction endonucleases

               transfected. The results of RT-PCR and Western blot showed the
               three siRNA expression vectors acted effectively and the
               expression of COX-2 was inhibited in different extent. In
               contrast to A2 cells, COX-2 mRNA levels of A2-3, A2-7 and A2-10
               cells were reduced 15.6\%, 20.4\% and 64.2\% respectively, and
               COX-2 protein expressions of them were reduced 23.7\%, 36.7\% and
               60.2\% respectively. The results of cell growth curve and
               clonogenic assay showed the growth of A2-10 cell slowed and the

               In group A the frequency of P. gingivalis showed statistically
               significant decrease at U1 (p=0.049) and U6 (p=0.008), from T1 to
               T2, and at U1 (p=0.048) from T1 to T3. In group B only the
               frequency of T. forsythia showed a statistically significant
               decrease, at U6 (T1 vs. T2, p=0.004; T1 vs. T3, p=0.0003).
               Regarding other analyzed bacteria, changes in the presence were
               noticed but no statistical significance was found. Conclusion.
               Placement of fixed appliances may have an impact on subgingival
               microflora, but in the first months after the placement and
               removal of the appliance changes were not significant, probably
               due to good oral hygiene. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike

              factors and enzymes. Each snRNP contains a ring-shaped subcomplex
              of seven proteins and a specific RNA molecule. The U6 snRNP
              contains a unique heptameric Lsm protein complex, which
              specifically recognizes the U6 small nuclear RNA at its 3' end.
              Here we report the crystal structures of the heptameric Lsm
              complex, both by itself and in complex with a 3' fragment of U6
              snRNA, at 2.8 Å resolution. Each of the seven Lsm proteins
              interacts with two neighbouring Lsm components to form a
              doughnut-shaped assembly, with the order Lsm3-2-8-4-7-5-6. The

              distinctive aspects of biogenesis such as transcription by RNA
              polymerase III, transcript nuclear retention and particular
              features of transcript ends: monomethylated 5'-guanosine
              triphosphate as cap structure and a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate moiety
              (>P) at the 3' termini. U6-snRNA plays a central role in splicing
              and thus its transcription, maturation, snRNP formation, and
              recycling are essential for cellular homeostasis. U6 snRNA enters
              the splicing cycle as part of the tri-U4/U6.U5snRNP complex, and
              after significant structural arrangements forms the catalytic site
              of the spliceosome together with U2 snRNA and Prp8. U6 snRNA also
              contributes to the splicing reaction by coordinating metal cations
              required for catalysis. Many human diseases are associated with
              altered splicing processes. Disruptions of the basal splicing
              machinery can be lethal or lead to severe diseases such as spinal
              muscular atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or retinitis

              that is responsible for removing 3'-terminal uridines from U6
              snRNA transcripts, which leads to the formation of a 2',3' cyclic
              phosphate moiety (>P). This maturation step is fundamental for U6
              snRNP assembly and recycling. Usb1 represents the first example of

              (∼500 residues) with unknown function and two Hel308-like modules

              splicing defects and severely impaired growth. This N-terminal
              truncation does not significantly affect Brr2's helicase activity.
              Brr2-Δ120 can be successfully assembled into the tri-snRNP (albeit
              at a lower level than the WT Brr2) and the spliceosomal B complex.

              snRNA helix I. How Prp16 destabilizes U2-U6 helix I is not clear.
              We show that the NineTeen Complex (NTC) protein Cwc2 displays
              genetic interactions with the U6 ACAGAGA, the U6 internal stem

  abstract  = "Titanite is a widespread accessory silicate which, in some
               deposits, hosts rare earth elements (REEs) at levels where it can
               be considered an important carrier. As titanite also accommodates
               Th and U at concentrations up to 2000 ppm, evidence of
               metamitctization, a process where radioactive decay of the
               actinides progressively damages the crystalline structure, is
               often observed. The current study aims to investigate how the
               extent of metamictization within a natural titanite specimen may
               impact its reactivity, principally in the context of REE
               recovery. Detailed structural characterization revealed the
               presence of crystalline domains coexisting with sectors having a
               dominant amorphous component. Compositionally, the density of
               irradiation-induced defects, leading to amorphization, shows a
               strong positive correlation not only with the abundance of
               actinides, but also with the REE concentration. Heat treatment of
               titanite performed at temperatures ranging from 400 to 800 °C
               indicates that, while the compositional zonation is maintained,
               thermal annealing of the defects results in progressive recovery
               of the crystalline structure. After treatment in sulfuric acid at
               200 °C, the habit of reacted titanite grains is highly irregular,
               indicating distinct decomposition rates for specific sectors,
               where the more refractory regions coincide with the REE-depleted
               crystalline domains. A more detailed visualization of the impact

               exposing polished grains to a 50\% NaOH solution at 50 °C,
               reveals that, for pristine titanite, the extent of etching
               observed on crystal surfaces is controlled by the density of the

               neutral NaCl solution. Organic compounds capable of corrosion
               inhibition must form a protective film over the metal surface.
               This is usually possible since many of these organic compounds
               possess strong interaction properties with metal and get adsorbed
               over its surface. These organic compounds contain electronegative
               functional groups and atoms like S, N, P, and O, which form
               center for establishment of adsorption process. Accordingly, SDS
               and DMImCl were chosen as organic compounds to test as corrosion
               inhibitors. Electrochemical polarization tests, performed in this
               study, reveal decrease in corrosion rate of mild steel in NaCl
               solution by 14.3 to 6.08 mpy (mils per year) corresponding to
               increased inhibition efficiency of 57.3\% on addition of up to
               200 ppm SDS. On mixing 200 ppm of DMImCl in NaCl + SDS solution,
               the inhibition efficiency enhances to 85.1\%. Similar outcome is
               also noticed from Electrochemical impedance and weight loss test
               results. Analysis of results obtained through FTIR, SEM/EDAX
               indicate adsorption of SDS/DMImCl mixture on the mild steel
               surface. Tensiometry tests, on ionic solution, reveal decrease in
               surface tension on addition of inhibitors with consequently
               increased surface activity and hydrophobic interaction between
               chains of the two inhibitors. Calculation done on the adsorption
               process indicates it to be ‘Langmuir adsorption isotherm’. This
               inference suggests that binding sites on steel surface are
               identical and homogeneously distributed. This layer is covered
               with a monolayer of adsorbed molecules i.e. DMImCl and SDS which

               behaviour has mostly been interpreted from laboratory-based
               studies rather than direct field observations, due to the
               scarcity of Te in the environment. The historic mining district
               of Moctezuma, Sonora, Mexico, hosts the only Au mine worldwide
               where native tellurium is the main ore mineral (Bambolla mine).
               In contrast to Bambolla, the nearby San Miguel mine features a
               typical epithermal-style assemblage of silver sulfides,
               selenides, and tellurides; this dichotomy provides comparative
               sites to study environmental Te mobility during weathering as a
               function of source composition (same host rock and climate). This
               study characterised the regolith geochemistry, mineralogy and
               microbial diversity around these two Te-enriched sites. Scanning
               electron microscopy of fresh mineral surfaces from the weathering
               zone suggests that Te was released to the environment through
               oxidative dissolution of primary Te minerals, especially native
               tellurium at Bambolla. Micron-scale gold grains (<100 μm) in
               regolith samples have morphologies consistent with the dealloying
               of the gold telluride calaverite (AuTe2). Secondary Te minerals
               observed in situ include abundant tellurite (TeO2) and highly
               Te-enriched Fe (hydr)oxides, which may contain up to 20 mole\% Te
               substitution for Fe. The presence of residual organic material in
               association with embedded secondary nano-minerals suggests that
               Te (bio)transformation processes were likely associated with
               weathering. In particular, carbon-rich globules on the surface of
               millimetre-sized grains of native tellurium contain abundant Te
               nanoparticles, suggestive of bioreduction. DNA extraction and
               sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that the
               Te-enriched (up to 1750 ppm) regolith proximal to the Te-rich
               veins hosted microbial communities with varying composition but
               similar overall diversity compared to regolith collected from
               distal locations (more than 50 m from the mineralised veins). Of
               the detected bacterial Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) from
               Te-rich regolith which could play an active role in Te
               (bio)transformation processes, representatives from the phyla
               Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria were the most
               abundant, followed by Firmicutes, candidate phylum WPS-2,
               Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes and Patescibacteria. This study
               provides the first evidence that Te undergoes dynamic cycling in

               governing the biogeochemical behaviour of Te on the macroscale.
               In doing so, this work provides important information on the

               on titanium (Ti) surface by phosphate chemical conversion (PCC)
               method. The effect of Zn2+ concentration in phosphate solution,
               which was regulated by increasing the addition amount of
               Zn(H2PO4)2·2H2O, on the microstructure and properties of the SZP
               coating was investigated. The characterization of the coating was
               carried out by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray

               increase of Zn2+ concentration in phosphate solution could induce
               the crystal morphology of the SZP coating to evolve from
               irregular granules (Zn(H2PO4)2·2H2O: 1 g/L) to regular cubic
               blocks (Zn(H2PO4)2·2H2O: 8 g/L). This morphological evolution
               process was accompanied by an increase in thickness (from 4.8 ±
               1.2 to 20.6 ± 1.9 μm), an improvement in wettability and
               corrosion resistance, as well as a decrease in the release amount
               of Sr2+ (from 3.97 ± 0.26 to 0.86 ± 0.12 ppm) and Zn2+ (from 0.31
               ± 0.01 to 0.18 ± 0.01 ppm) after 21 days of immersion. In vitro
               evaluations proved that the adhesion, proliferation, and
               differentiation of MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts on SZP coatings,
               especially for the coating with tiny cubic-block crystals, were

               pollutant levels varied with the characteristics of underground

               platforms from 39 randomly selected underground stations in
               Singapore. We used generalized linear models to assess the
               variability of air pollutant concentrations with station
               characteristics. We computed commuter-weighted pollutant-specific
               station rankings to inform mitigation priority. PM2.5 (mean =
               24.1 μg/m3) and PM10 (mean = 26.9 μg/m3) concentrations across
               commuter platforms were generally lower than those found outdoors
               while platform CO2 levels (mean = 608.1 ppm) were 1.7 times those
               outdoors. More stations exceeded the WHO 24-h mean exposure
               guidelines values for PM2.5 (n = 30, 73\%) than for PM10 (n = 4,
               10\%). PM2.5, PM10 and CO2 levels were lowest in stations on the
               Circle, North-East and Downtown lines. PM2.5 and PM10
               concentrations at platforms were positively associated with their
               outdoor concentrations. Mean CO2 concentration levels at
               platforms were the highest during commuter rush hours. Longer
               train arrival intervals were associated with lower CO2 levels.
               PM2.5 and PM10 levels in stations were negatively associated with
               the depth of the commuter platforms. Commuter volumes influenced
               the priority ranking of mitigation measures. Underground metro
               stations exhibited high variability and dependence on station
               characteristics as well as outdoor ambient pollutant levels. Our

               component of the Mg-suite rocks of the Procellarum KREEP Terrane
               (PKT), one of three major lunar crustal terranes, is unclear. In
               an attempt to determine its origin, we estimated the composition
               of host magmas of plutonic rocks, including Mg-suite rocks and
               evolved rocks, from the PKT (PKT-host magmas) by using secondary
               ion mass spectrometry analyses of plagioclase. Calculated
               partition coefficients for Sr, Ba and Ti between plagioclase and
               melts, taking into account the anorthite content of plagioclase,
               temperature and bulk rock major-element compositions, were
               applied to determine parental magma compositions. The PKT-host
               magmas contained 160–360 ppm Sr, 520–7600 ppm Ba and 1.1–7.0
               wt.\% TiO2; most of them had higher Ti and Ba concentrations than
               KREEP basalts and high-K KREEP. We used phase relations based on
               the Rhyolite-MELTS algorithm to explore the evolution of the
               PKT-host magmas and KREEP basalts from two bulk silicate moon
               (BSM) starting compositions, a BSM with chondritic ratios of
               refractory elements, and a crustal-component-enriched BSM with
               non-chondritic ratios of refractory elements. We propose a
               three-stage evolution model. Stage-1: polybaric multi-step
               fractionation from a BSM magma to form ferroan anorthosite (FAN)
               crust and an evolved magma as the first KREEP-rich component
               (M0). Stage-2: assimilation and fractional crystallization (AFC)
               of M0, early cumulate and FAN associated with deep mantle
               overturn and impact events to form the PKT-host magmas, Mg-suite
               rocks and an evolved magma as the second KREEP-rich component
               (K0). Stage-3: further AFC cycles of K0, Mg-suite rocks or FAN
               associated with shallow mantle overturn and impact events to form
               KREEP basalts. This three-stage model for a
               crustal-component-enriched BSM with non-chondritic ratios of
               refractory elements (e.g., a sub-chondritic Ti/Ba ratio)
               reproduced the compositions of both the host magmas of FAN and
               the PKT-host magmas that fractionated to form the Mg-suite rocks
               and KREEP basalts of the PKT region. In particular, the model
               reproduced the high Ti and Ba contents of the PKT-host magmas we
               estimated from plagioclase composition. Variations of TiO2 and Ba
               contents (and hence Ti/Ba ratios) of the magmas were critical
               controls on their evolution. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",

  abstract  = "Despite being a wood-derived biomaterial, wood ash generated by
               Canadian pulp paper mills (PPM) is generally landfilled. This is
               mainly because of the heterogeneous nature of ash, variations in
               ash quality and differences in the requirement of ash
               applications. Unlike limited past work on ash analysis for
               environmental compliance purposes for specific mills, a
               comprehensive database of ash quality for the PPM has been
               developed. Samples of three ash streams, bottom ash (BA),
               multiclone ash and electrostatic precipitator (ESP) ash, were
               collected. They were analyzed for physical, chemical and
               engineering properties of relevance to potential ash uses in
               areas such as the construction industry, compost production, soil
               amendment and waste stabilization/ solidification. Results show
               that the ash quality varied widely from one mill to another. Even
               within a mill individual ash streams varied substantially in
               properties. For example, the unburned carbon, a unique parameter
               for wood ash, in multiclone ash could be over twice the amount in
               the ESP ash. It is suggested that the traditional definition of
               fly ash (FA) could be refined to multiclone ash and ESP (or
               baghouse) ash thereby promoting the source segregation concept
               for the various ash streams produced at a mill. It is believed
               that the ash segregation approach, whereby ash sub-streams are
               kept separate to preserve their quality for specific uses, will
               minimize heterogeneity and quality variations of ash. This study
               will not only help divert wood ash away from landfills in favour
               of beneficial applications but also reduce carbon footprint of a
               mill. © 2021",

               risk factor for developing several lung diseases such as Chronic
               Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). CS consists of a complex
               mixture of over 6000 chemicals including the highly reactive
               α,β-unsaturated aldehyde acrolein. Acrolein is thought to be
               responsible for a large proportion of the non-cancer disease risk
               associated with smoking. Emerging evidence suggest a key role for
               CS-induced abnormalities in mitochondrial morphology and function
               in airway epithelial cells in COPD pathogenesis. Although in
               vitro studies suggest acrolein-induced mitochondrial dysfunction
               in airway epithelial cells, it is unknown if in vivo inhalation
               of acrolein affects mitochondrial content or the pathways
               controlling this. In this study, rats were acutely exposed to
               acrolein by inhalation (nose-only; 0−4 ppm), 4 h/day for 1 or 2
               consecutive days (n = 6/group). Subsequently, the activity and
               abundance of key constituents of mitochondrial metabolic pathways
               as well as expression of critical proteins and genes controlling
               mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy were investigated in lung
               homogenates. A transient decreasing response in protein and
               transcript abundance of subunits of the electron transport chain
               complexes was observed following acrolein inhalation. Moreover,
               acrolein inhalation caused a decreased abundance of key
               regulators associated with mitochondrial biogenesis, respectively
               a differential response on day 1 versus day 2. Abundance of
               components of the mitophagy machinery was in general unaltered in
               response to acrolein exposure in rat lung. Collectively, this
               study demonstrates that acrolein inhalation acutely and
               dose-dependently disrupts the molecular regulation of
               mitochondrial metabolism in rat lung. Hence, understanding the
               effect of acrolein on mitochondrial function will provide a
               scientifically supported reasoning to shortlist aldehydes

  abstract  = "Rodenticides are widely used around the world since the 1950s. In
               Taiwan, an anti-rodent operation initiated 1977 and became a
               regular action annually implied by the government until 2014.
               This anti-rodent operation caused many animals of non-target
               species being exposed by rodenticides and became an environmental
               issue. The Black-winged Kite (Elanus caeruleus) is a small-sized
               diurnal raptor widely distributed in the Old World continent.
               Since 2000, a newly colonized population of this species occurred
               in Taiwan. Although the Black-winged Kites may suffer from the
               threats of rodenticides, the population is still growing and soon
               became the most abundant raptor in farmlands of Taiwan. Whether
               the Black-winged Kite accumulates higher anticoagulant
               rodenticide residues than other raptors are still unclear. In
               this study, liver samples of Black-winged Kites were collected
               from 2013 to 2016, when the detected residues of anticoagulant
               rodenticides increased annually. The concentration of residue
               rodenticide was above 0.2 ppm among 30\% of the detected samples,
               which is the toxicity threshold concentration of other raptors.
               In the meanwhile, the lesser ricefield rat (Rattus losea), the
               most common prey of Black-winged Kites, also extended the
               survival period after fed on rodenticide. The longer survival
               days after being poisoned can enhance the predation opportunity
               of raptors, thus affect the accumulated rodenticides in the
               raptors. This study demonstrates that the Black-winged Kite has
               higher concentration of anticoagulant rodenticide than most other
               raptors, which provide the case that the raptor can quickly
               accumulate rodenticide residues within a short period of time. ©

               winemaking to help improve sensory characteristics. Some of these
               materials may contain or be derived from allergenic foods, such
               as eggs. In order to ensure food safety and that products meet
               regulatory compliance, it is essential to have robust and
               effective analytical methods to verify the removal of allergenic
               proteins following their use. Current methods include ELISA and
               MS methods, which can target either whole foods or individual
               proteins, and provide either quantitative data or qualitative
               confirmation of proteins. MS methods offer the potential to test
               for multiple proteins within a single assay to improve cost and
               efficiency, whereas ELISA methods typically analyze for a single
               protein per assay. OBJECTIVE: This study focuses on the
               development of a LC-tandem MS (MS/MS) quantitative method for
               lysozyme in white wine and compares performance across two
               laboratories utilizing two different instrument platforms.
               METHODS: Lysozyme target peptides were selected by conducting
               bottom-up discovery proteomics. Candidate targets were evaluated
               using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) or selected reaction
               monitoring (SRM) LC-MS/MS, depending on the instrument in each
               laboratory. Quantification of lysozyme was conducted using
               internal, stable isotope-labeled synthetic peptide standards.
               RESULTS: Three of eight candidate target peptides showed
               performance suitable for the final quantitative method. White
               wine spiked with 0.1 and 0.5 ppm lysozyme demonstrated
               quantitative recovery of 70-120\%. While the PRM method delivered
               better repeatability, the SRM method gave higher quantitative
               recovery values. CONCLUSION: A targeted LC-MS/MS method for
               quantification of lysozyme in white wine has been developed and
               deployed on two different MS instrument platforms in two
               laboratories. HIGHLIGHTS: Both SRM and PRM targeted LC-MS/MS
               methodologies can be used for quantification of lysozyme in white
               wine. This study is among the first to evaluate an MS method for
               food allergen quantification in multiple laboratories. © AOAC

               can achieve with highly internal entrainment. The model
               validation was first taken place with the existing experimental
               results under non-reacting conditions, and it is demonstrated
               that the mean velocity profiles predicted are in satisfactorily
               good agreement with the existing data in the combustor. Then, the
               methane and the hydrogen-rich fuel were consumed at an
               equivalence ratio of 0.8 and a thermal power of 10 kW under
               distributed conditions which means that oxygen concentration in
               the oxidizer is reduced from 21\% to 15\% along with internal
               entrainment for each fuel used. The results showed that the

               distributed regime in a gas turbine combustion chamber. With
               hydrogen enrichment, it is aimed at increasing combustion
               performance of those fuels. However, in this circumstance, it is
               obvious to increase the flame temperature with taking place
               hydrogen enrichment. Thus colorless distributed combustion (CDC),
               which is one of the advanced combustion techniques, can be
               suggested to control flame temperature with slowing down the
               reaction rate, resulting in ultra-low NOX emissions and more
               uniform temperature distribution with a broadened flame. For this
               purpose, the hydrogen-enriched kerosene fuels were examined by
               modeling a CFD code using the eddy dissipation concept, the
               radiation model (P-1) and the turbulence model (standard k-ε). In
               this way, the thermal fields and the NOX distributions have been
               obtained. The results showed that hydrogen enrichment increased
               the flame temperatures from about 2490 K to 2605 K at
               air-combustion conditions until 30\% H2, resulting in the NOX
               levels predicted increased in the combustor. With reducing oxygen
               percentage the flame started to be the broadened one. The flame
               temperatures decreased, for instance, from about 2605 K to 2230 K
               at 15\% O2 for the 30\% H2 containing fuel. As a result of this,
               the NOX levels reduced from about 30 ppm to the values lower than
               1 ppm in the combustor. It is concluded that increments in
               temperature and NOX levels with hydrogen can be suppressed with
               distributed regime, which enables that gas turbines can be
               operated at wider flammability limits with hydrogen enrichment. ©

               In this regard, researchers focus on the studies on emission
               reduction. Hydrogen is an alternative solution for this problem.
               Hydrogen produces only water as a result of combustion with
               oxygen. Therefore, this study examines the combustion stability
               and emissions of a high hydrogen content fuel mixture. The fuel
               mixture containing 45\% H2 by volume was supported with 5\% CH4
               in order to provide stable combustion. In addition, in order to
               reduce the instabilities caused by the high laminar burning rate
               of hydrogen, it was diluted with 50\% CO2 which equal volume with
               the fuel mixture. After the fuel mixture containing 45\% H2 - 5\%
               CH4 - 50\% CO2 was burned with air containing 21\% O2, enrichment
               was applied at the rates of 24\% and 27\% O2. The flame that
               contains different oxygen ratios was acoustically forced through
               the speakers around the combustion chamber. The stability data,
               dynamic pressure, and light intensity fluctuation of the flame
               were recorded under different acoustic resonance frequencies (110
               Hz, 190 Hz, 260 Hz). In this way, the oxygen enrichment
               performance and flame characteristics of hydrogen in a premixed
               burner, which is promising in zero-emission studies, were
               investigated. As a result, when the combustion condition of 21\%
               O2 and 24\% O2 ratios are compared, the instability increased
               slightly from 801 Pa to 887 Pa, respectively. However, at 27\%
               O2, the flame could not perform a stable combustion under
               acoustic enforcement. The flame flashbacked with a dynamic
               pressure fluctuation of 1577 Pa under an acoustic frequency of
               110 Hz. In addition, it was observed that CO emissions have
               decreased with the increase in oxygen enrichment rate. CO
               emission measured at 1080 ppm at 21\% O2 decreased to 542 ppm and
               276 ppm respectively at 24\% and 27\% oxygen enrichment levels.
               While NOx emission was measured at 10 ppm in the case of
               combustion with air, it was observed that decreased to 4 ppm at

               in multiple fields due to its cost-effectiveness and
               environmental protection. However, due to the lack of the
               amphiphilic structure, the HNS is unable to reduce interfacial
               tension (IFT), which is adverse to the recovery of residual oil
               from reservoirs. Therefore, it is of great significance to
               prepare amphiphilic Janus nano-silica similar to surfactant for
               enhanced oil recovery (EOR). In this present work, a

               IFT, which made the residual oil remobilize inside the pore
               throats. The measurement result of the contact angle illustrated
               that the oil-wet thin slice treated with the nanofluid became
               water wet. SEM and EDS techniques indicated that the adsorption
               of the SAJNS on the surface of the thin slice was responsible for
               the wetting alteration. Besides, almost all the crude oil
               adsorbed on the glass slide face was stripped after immersion in
               the nanofluid. The core flooding experiment demonstrated that the
               injected nanofluid helped to recover residual oil and decrease
               injection pressure. The NMR results presented that most recovered
               residual oil was from the micropores. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",

               rock record produced during low-pressure, closed-system
               crystallization of Fe-rich tholeiitic magma. The lead isotope
               compositions of plagioclase feldspar in cumulates and related
               igneous rocks of the Skaergaard intrusion were determined
               directly from single spot analyses in thin section by laser
               ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS)
               (n = 757). Plagioclase primocrysts, typically with <2 ppm Pb, and
               feldspar in interstitial pockets from the Layered Series and from
               most of the Marginal Border Series have the same Pb isotope
               compositions within analytical uncertainty (208Pb/206Pb = 2.20 ±
               0.06; 207Pb/206Pb = 0.889 ± 0.028). There are no significant Pb
               isotope differences between cores and rims of individual
               plagioclase primocrysts or between different types of
               interstitial pockets (e.g., interstitial granophyre,
               symplectites). These Pb isotope compositions are less radiogenic
               than those from most of the contemporaneous East Greenland flood
               basalts indicative of crustal contamination at deeper crustal
               levels prior to emplacement. Plagioclase from three samples of
               the Marginal Border Series adjacent to host gneisses (<5 m from
               the contact) have higher 208Pb/206Pb (2.30 ± 0.06, 2.35 ± 0.02,
               2.51 ± 0.21) compared to the rest of the intrusion. These results
               confirm that crystallization of the Skaergaard intrusion occurred
               under essentially closed-system conditions with localized minor
               incorporation of “amphibolitic” gneiss. Hydrothermal alteration
               occurred at near-solidus to subsolidus conditions by circulating
               meteoric fluid that had equilibrated with the overlying flood
               basalts. This alteration resulted in albitized interstitial
               granophyre and rare spot analyses from plagioclase primocrysts
               characterized by Pb isotope compositions comparable to those of
               the flood basalts. Granophyres of different origins (e.g.,
               transgressive granophyre, granophyric segregation) have variable
               Pb isotope compositions (208Pb/206Pb = 2.09–2.51; 207Pb/206Pb =
               0.844–1.013) that are distinct from the Skaergaard cumulates.
               Based on Pb isotope systematics, combined with published Sr–Nd
               isotopic compositions and 40Ar/39Ar geochronology from East
               Greenland and Faroe Island basalts, the Skaergaard intrusion is
               linked to eruption of the earliest of the Plateau Basalts in East
               Greenland (Milne Land Formation) during continental breakup and

               patient-specific distortion with standard high bandwidth scans
               can result in unnecessary sacrifices of signal to noise ratio.
               This study investigates a technique for distortion detection and
               mitigation on a patient specific basis. Approach. Fast B0 mapping
               was performed using a previously developed technique for
               high-resolution, large dynamic range field mapping without the
               need for phase unwrapping algorithms. A phantom study was
               performed to validate the method. Distortion mitigation was
               validated by reducing geometric distortion with increased
               acquisition bandwidth and confirmed by both the B0 mapping
               technique and manual measurements. Images and contours from 25
               brain stereotactic radiosurgery patients and 95 targets were
               analyzed to estimate the range of geometric distortions expected
               in the brain and to estimate bandwidth required to keep all
               treatment targets within the ±0.5 mm iso-distortion contour. Main
               Results. The phantom study showed, at 3 T, the technique can
               measure distortions with a mean absolute error of 0.12 mm (0.18
               ppm), and a maximum error of 0.37 mm (0.6 ppm). For image
               acquisition at 3 T and 1.0 mm resolution, mean absolute
               distortion under 0.5 mm in patients required bandwidths from 109
               to 200 Hz px-1 for patients with the least and most distortion,
               respectively. Maximum absolute distortion under 0.5 mm required
               bandwidths from 120 to 390 Hz px-1. Significance. The method for
               B0 mapping was shown to be valid and may be applied to assess
               distortion clinically. Future work will adapt the readout
               bandwidth to prospectively mitigate distortion with the goal to
               improve radiosurgery treatment outcomes by reducing healthy

               capture from the atmosphere [direct air capture, (DAC)] is more
               relevant than ever. Herein, an electrochemically mediated DAC
               system is reported which utilizes affinity of redox-active
               quinone moieties towards CO2 molecules, and unlike incumbent
               chemisorption technologies which require temperature or pH swing,
               relies solely on the electrochemical voltage for CO2 capture and
               release. The design and operation of a DAC system is demonstrated
               with stackable bipolar cells using quinone chemistry.
               Specifically, poly(vinylanthraquinone) (PVAQ) negative electrode
               undergoes a two-electron reduction reaction and reversibly
               complexes with CO2, leading to CO2 sequestration from the feed

               release of CO2. The performance of both small- and meso-scale
               cells for DAC are evaluated with feed CO2 concentrations as low
               as 400 ppm (0.04 \%), and energy consumption is demonstrated as
               low as 113 kJ per mole of CO2 captured. Notably, the bipolar cell
               construct is modular and expandable, equally suitable for small

               groups. The structure of the resulting 1,2,4-triazole-doped
               graphene oxide (NGO) is proved by Fourier transform infrared
               spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra. The
               polybenzimidazole (PBI)/NGO composite membranes (NGO
               content:0.5\%, 1\%, 3\%, 5\%) were also prepared and subjected to
               the absorption of various suitable amounts of phosphoric acid
               (PA). As expected, the composite membranes well maintained their
               superior mechanical properties (57-69 MPa) containing 2 PA
               molecules per PBI unit. The morphological characterization using
               the atomic force microscopy phase images and transmission
               electron microscopy analysis revealed a micro-phase separation,
               providing continuous ionic channels and ultimately enhancing the
               ionic conductivity. As a result, the maximum proton conductivity
               of 27 mS cm−1 is achieved for PBI/NGO-3 membrane (NGO content:
               3\%) at 160°C under anhydrous conditions, and the maximum power
               density of the cell using PBI/NGO-3 membrane is 254 mW cm−2.
               These composite membranes displayed great potential for
               high-temperature proton exchange membranes under anhydrous
               conditions. The scanning electron microscopy images further
               showed the condensed structures with the suitable quantity of NGO
               in the composite membranes due to the hydrogen bonding and
               acid–base interactions between NGO and PBI. This condensed
               structure improved the mechanical properties, enhanced thermal
               stability, and increased oxidative stability of the composite
               membranes. Additionally, the PBI/NGO/PA composite membranes
               exhibit high thermal decomposition temperature (Td[5\%] higher
               than 284°C) and superior tensile strengths (greater than 55 MPa).
               Remarkably, the membranes demonstrated exceptional oxidative
               stability and could maintain less than 15\% quantity loss for
               more than 200 hours in Fenton's reagent (3 wt\% H2O2, 4 ppm

               electrolytic oxidation (PEO) process, the application of
               silane-based coatings as an eco-friendly layer is a promising way
               to diminish penetration of the corrosive species into the PEO
               coating by pores sealing. In this study, to enhance the corrosion
               protection of AA2024, the performance of the duplex system
               achieved by adding different concentrations in sodium
               montmorillonite (Na-MMT) dispersed into the silane coating was
               assessed. In this study, a hybrid sol-gel layer (30\% V/V)
               obtained from tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and
               3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) sol-gel solution was
               applied on AA2024 previously covered by an optimized PEO layer
               using a solution containing sodium silicate and potassium
               hydroxide solution as electrolyte. Electrochemical impedance
               spectroscopy (EIS) revealed the significant impact of the
               sol-gel/clay nanocomposite layer on the corrosion protection
               performance of the PEO layer on the AA2024 substrate in a 0.1 M

               different coating systems upon five weeks exposure to the
               aggressive solution reported the sealing ability of the sol-gel
               coatings in which the silane coating modified with 1000 ppm of
               clay nanoparticles had the maximum corrosion resistance among
               them (i.e., higher than 107 after 5 weeks immersion). The
               flake-like structure of sodium montmorillonite not only enhanced
               the barrier performance, but also FT-IR outcomes reflected the
               reticulation of the silane network through the interaction of
               nanoparticles with SiOH groups of the silane layer. © 2022

               In this study, experimental and numerical methodologies were

               under oxygen enrichment conditions for the simultaneous reduction
               of greenhouse gases and fine dust precursors. Flameless
               combustion was achieved under all conditions, and numerical
               simulations using GRI-mech 3.0 and the eddy dissipation concept
               were validated by comparison with the experimental temperature
               and NO values. With decreasing oxygen fraction in the oxidant,
               the main reaction zone of the 100\% CH4 case is expanded owing to
               an increase in internal recirculation. Under the oxygen-enriched
               conditions, when mixed with H2 and CO, fuel oxidation is promoted
               compared to the 100\% CH4 case. Less than 25 ppm of NO was
               emitted for all but the H2 addition case, where the emission
               increased to approximately 95 ppm. During flameless combustion,
               NO formation by the N2O intermediate route is dominant regardless
               of the fuel composition and oxygen fraction, and the proportion

               confirmed the water-wet system with the mean of the macroscopic
               and apparent contact angle distributions being 39.77° and 59.75°

               binders on the mechanical and microstructural properties of PPMs
               are analyzed experimentally and through machine learning.
               Polyurethane and epoxy, which are widely used due to their
               reasonable cost and high performance, are considered as polymer
               binders, and specimens with different aggregate size
               distributions are fabricated using these polymers. The mechanical
               properties of the specimens are analyzed using compressive and
               flexural strength tests, freeze–thaw durability tests, and water
               permeability tests. Then, the internal microstructure is
               characterized using micro-computed tomography, including the pore
               size distribution, pore sphericity, anisotropic ratios of the
               pores, pore tortuosity, and aggregate sphericity. The correlation

               and compressive strength of PPMs according to the aggregate size
               distribution and the properties of the polymer. The model was

               mineralization. Four types of tourmaline are recognized: (1)
               tourmaline in coarse-grained monzogranite (Tur-G1); (2)
               tourmaline in medium-fine-grained monzogranite (Tur-G2); (3)
               tourmaline aggregates associated with muscovite in greisen
               (Tur-Gr), showing a yellow core (Tur-Gry) and blue rim (Tur-Grb);
               and (4) quartz-vein-hosted tourmaline (Tur-V). In this study, we
               performed systematic investigations of in situ boron isotopic and
               elemental compositions of tourmalines in different granite,
               greisen, and quartz veins by EPMA and LA-MC-ICP-MS. Results show
               that almost all tourmalines exhibit schorl compositional affinity
               with extremely low Ca contents, high Fe/(Fe+Mg), and the
               calculated X-site occupancies in tourmalines show their
               affinities to the alkali group. Substitution processes of major
               element variations are dominantly caused by MgFe-1, FeAl-1,
               (Ca,Mg)(□-1,Al-2), and R(Na,Mg)-1 exchange vectors. Based on
               geochemistry and petrology, Tur-G1, Tur-G2, and Tur-Gry
               precipitated from a boron-rich melt, while Tur-Grb and Tur-V
               crystallized from hydrothermal fluid. Many trace element
               concentrations overlap and most are <10 ppm. The significantly
               higher contents of Sn and Zn and positive Eu anomaly reflect the
               influence of an external fluid. Magmatic tourmalines fall into a
               narrow range of δ11B values between -15.58 and -14.09‰,
               indicating a single boron source of the granitic magma.
               Hydrothermal tourmalines display slightly lighter B isotopic
               compositions (-16.31 to -14.91‰), which are consistent with
               precipitation from externally derived fluids with lighter boron.
               Based on the isotopic and chemical compositional evidence, Sn and
               Zn may come from the host rock rather than granite. © 2022

              the intervening sequences that are present in most eukaryotic
              pre-mRNAs. At its core are five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein
              complexes, the U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNPs, which undergo dynamic

              rounds of splicing requires reversion to their original
              configurations, but little is known about this process. Here, we
              show that ZK863.4/USIP-1 (U Six snRNA-Interacting Protein-1) is a
              ribonucleotidyl transferase that promotes accumulation of the

              tested their effect on splicing using a yeast in vitro U6
              depletion/complementation system. Elimination of selected RNA
              tertiary interactions involving the U6 catalytic triad, or
              deletions of the bases of U6-U80 or U6-A59, had moderate to no
              effect on splicing, showing that the affected secondary and
              tertiary interactions are not required for splicing catalysis.
              However, removal of the base of U6-G60 of the catalytic triad
              completely blocked splicing, without affecting assembly of the
              activated spliceosome or its subsequent conversion into a B*-like
              complex. Our data suggest that the catalytic configuration of the
              RNA core that allows catalytic metal M1 binding can be maintained
              by Protein-RNA contacts. However, RNA stacking interactions in the
              U2/U6 RNA core are required for productive coordination of metal
              M2. The functional conformation of the U2/U6 RNA core is thus
              highly buffered, with overlapping contributions from RNA-RNA and

              implicated in catalyzing the splicing of pre-mRNA, but assembly
              and rearrangement steps prior to catalysis require numerous
              proteins. Previous studies have shown that the protein-free U2-U6
              snRNA complex adopts two conformations in equilibrium,
              characterized by four and three helices surrounding a central
              junction. The four-helix conformer is strongly favored in the in
              vitro protein-free state, but the three-helix conformer
              predominates in spliceosomes. To analyze the role of the central
              junction in positioning elements forming the active site, we
              derived three-dimensional models of the two conformations from
              distances measured between fluorophores at selected locations in
              constructs representing the protein-free human U2-U6 snRNA complex
              by time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Data
              describing four angles in the four-helix conformer suggest
              tetrahedral geometry; addition of Mg results in shortening of the
              distances between neighboring helices, indicating compaction of
              the complex around the junction. In contrast, the three-helix
              conformer shows a closer approach between helices bearing critical
              elements, but the addition of Mg widens the distance between them;
              thus in neither conformer are the critical helices positioned to
              favor the proposed triplex interaction. The presence of Mg also
              enhances the fraction of the three-helix conformer, as does
              incubation with the Prp19-related protein RBM22, which has been
              implicated in the remodeling of the U2-U6 snRNA complex to render
              it catalytically active. These data suggest that although the
              central junction assumes a significant role in orienting helices,
              spliceosomal proteins and Mg facilitate formation of the
              catalytically active conformer.",

              snRNA is catalyzed by METTL16, and is important for the 5'-splice
              site recognition by U6 snRNA during pre-mRNA splicing. Human
              METTL16 consists of the N-terminal methyltransferase domain (MTD)
              and the C-terminal vertebrate conserved region (VCR). While the
              MTD has an intrinsic property to recognize a specific sequence in
              the distinct structural context of RNA, the VCR functions have
              remained uncharacterized. Here, we present structural and
              functional analyses of the human METTL16 VCR. The VCR increases
              the affinity of METTL16 toward U6 snRNA, and the conserved basic
              region in VCR is important for the METTL16-U6 snRNA interaction.
              The VCR structure is topologically homologous to the C-terminal
              RNA binding domain, KA1, in U6 snRNA-specific terminal uridylyl
              transferase 1 (TUT1). A chimera of the N-terminal MTD of METTL16
              and the C-terminal KA1 of TUT1 methylated U6 snRNA more
              efficiently than the MTD, indicating the functional conservation
              of the VCR and KA1 for U6 snRNA biogenesis. The VCR interacts with
              the internal stem-loop (ISL) within U6 snRNA, and this interaction
              would induce the conformational rearrangement of the
              A43-containing region of U6 snRNA, thereby modifying the RNA
              structure to become suitable for productive catalysis by the MTD.
              Therefore, the MTD and VCR in METTL16 cooperatively facilitate the

              The role of these modifications in pre-mRNA splicing as well as

              unclear. Here we report that the La-related protein LARP7

               device in a 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) -induced rat tongue
               cancer model. If successful, this would facilitate early
               detection of OSCC. The rats (3 groups of 5) were administered 50
               ppm 4NQO in their drinking water over a period of 10, 15, or 20
               weeks. Five non-treated rats were used as a control group. Images

               Immunoreaction for anti-CK13, anti-CK17, and anti-E-cadherin
               antibodies was also histopathologically evaluated. Receiver

               cut-off values, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the

               and 10-week groups, with an increase observed in its average
               value and range in the latter. These findings differed from those
               characteristic of leukoplakia. No significant difference was
               observed in the positive cell rate for immunoreaction for
               anti-CK13 or anti-CK17 antibodies between the control and 10-week

               ratio of immunoreaction for anti-E-cadherin antibody in the
               10-week group in comparison with in the control group (p <0.05).
               These results showed that disruption of intercellular adhesion

               cut-off value in the 10-week and control groups was 51.9,
               sensitivity 95.5\%, and specificity 96.9\%. This indicated that

               promising method to replace the anthraquinone process for
               hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. However, the efficiency of
               this process suffers from sluggish kinetics, particularly in an
               acidic environment. Therefore, employing catalysts with high
               electroactivity is highly desirable for H2O2 synthesis. Here, an
               effective strategy for preparing Co-N-C/Ti3C2Tx with high H2O2
               selectivity and ORR reactivity is proposed. The acquired
               Co-N-C/Ti3C2Tx shows excellent H2O2 electrosynthesis performance
               in acidic media with H2O2 productivity of up to 3200 ppm h-1,
               superior to state-of-the-art catalysts. Interestingly, a H2O2
               concentration of 6.0 wt \% was obtained after the stability test,
               and the Co-N-C/Ti3C2Tx catalyst was found to effectively catalyze
               organic dye degradation. Further analysis reveals that the
               enhanced H2O2 electrosynthesis performance originates from the
               layered structure and the oxygen functional groups of Ti3C2Tx.
               The layered structure can effectively promote increased exposure
               of active sites, while the oxygen functional groups will
               fine-tune the electronic structure of Co atoms, allowing a
               selective ORR pathway to produce H2O2. This work provides a
               strategy to design and fabricate highly efficient catalysts for

               nanoparticles and multilayer carbon nanotubes composite
               (TiO2/MWCNT) as sensing film, featuring desirable advantages of
               high sensitivity, selectivity, and real-time detection.
               Benefiting from special structure and large specific surface area
               of MWCNTs, the adsorption capacity of sensing surface to gas
               molecules can be significantly enhanced. Moreover, the high

               TiO2/MWCNT composite film result in an obvious improvement of

               red-shifted absorptions (Δλabs up to 25 nm) and emissions (Δλem
               up to 73 nm, ΦPL up to 51 \%). Quite interestingly, a general
               dynamic stereoisomerism phenomenon is evidenced for the compounds
               derived from achiral DAOTA cores. At low temperature in 1H NMR
               spectroscopy (218 K), N−CH2 protons become diastereotopic with
               chemical shifts differences (Δδ) as high as +1.64 ppm. The signal
               coalescence occurs around 273 K with a barrier of ∼12 kcal mol−1.
               This phenomenon is due to planar chiral conformations (Sp and Rp
               configurations), induced by the geometry of the alkyl (n-propyl)
               side-chains next to the acetylenic substituents. Ion pairing
               studies with Δ-TRISPHAT anion not only confirm the occurrence of
               the chiral conformations but evidence a moderate but definite
               asymmetric induction from the chiral anion onto the cations.
               Finally, DFT calculations offer a valuable insight on the
               geometries, the corresponding stereodynamics and also on the very
               large difference in NMR for some of the diastereotopic protons. ©

  abstract  = "In order to improve Super-Kamiokande's neutron detection
               efficiency and to thereby increase its sensitivity to the diffuse
               supernova neutrino background flux, 13 tons of Gd2(SO4)3⋅8H2O
               (gadolinium sulfate octahydrate) was dissolved into the
               detector's otherwise ultrapure water from July 14 to August 17,
               2020, marking the start of the SK-Gd phase of operations. During
               the loading, water was continuously recirculated at a rate of 60
               m3/h, extracting water from the top of the detector and mixing it
               with concentrated Gd2(SO4)3⋅8H2O solution to create a 0.02\%
               solution of the Gd compound before injecting it into the bottom
               of the detector. A clear boundary between the Gd-loaded and pure
               water was maintained through the loading, enabling monitoring of
               the loading itself and the spatial uniformity of the Gd
               concentration over the 35 days it took to reach the top of the
               detector. During the subsequent commissioning the recirculation
               rate was increased to 120 m3/h, resulting in a constant and
               uniform distribution of Gd throughout the detector and water
               transparency equivalent to that of previous pure-water operation
               periods. Using an Am–Be neutron calibration source the mean
               neutron capture time was measured to be 115±1 μs, which
               corresponds to a Gd concentration of 111±2 ppm, as expected for
               this level of Gd loading. This paper describes changes made to
               the water circulation system for this detector upgrade, the Gd
               loading procedure, detector commissioning, and the first neutron
               calibration measurements in SK-Gd. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",

              hot carriers in QD array photoelectrodes before they relax to the
              band edges through phonon emission. The latter effect is based on
              utilizing hot carriers in QD solar cells to generate and collect
              additional electron-hole pairs through enhanced impact ionization
              processes. Three QD solar cell configurations are described: (1)
              photoelectrodes comprising QD arrays, (2) QD-sensitized
              nanocrystalline TiO $_2$, and (3) QDs dispersed in a blend of
              electron- and hole- conducting polymers. These high-efficiency
              configurations require slow hot carrier cooling times, and we
              discuss initial results on slowed hot electron cooling in InP QDs.",

              be enhanced or reduced compared with its vacuum level by tuning
              discrete cavity modes in and out of resonance with the emitter.

              when the conditions for strong coupling are fulfilled. In this

               performance analysis based on QoS and RMA standards. The
               parameters (Qos and RMA) will be comparing with Nine Availability
               standards. The test scenario is based on the number of users and
               the operational time of WMN. The test results shown that WMN has
               QoS performance on each parameter are as follows : packet loss
               0\%, delay 28 ms, jitter 3.7 ms and throughput 1058 kbps and RMA
               performance with Nines Availability standard with one nine and

               efficacy of same-day discharge (SDD) after transcatheter aortic
               valve replacement (TAVR) during the COVID-19 pandemic.
               Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed significant stress
               on health care systems worldwide. SDD in highly selected TAVR
               patients can facilitate the provision of essential cardiovascular
               care while managing competing COVID-19 resource demands. Methods:
               Patient selection for SDD was at the discretion of the local
               multidisciplinary heart team, across 7 international sites. The
               primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke,
               myocardial infarction, all-cause readmission, major vascular
               complications, and new permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation.
               Results: From March 2020 to August 2021, 124 of 2,100 patients
               who underwent elective transfemoral TAVR were selected for SDD.
               The average age was 78.9 ± 7.8 years, the median Society of
               Thoracic Surgeons score was 2.4 (IQR: 1.4-4.2), and 32.3\% (n =
               40) had preexisting PPMs. There were no major vascular
               complications, strokes, or deaths during the index admission. One
               patient (0.8\%) required PPM implantation for complete heart
               block and was discharged the same day. No patient required a PPM
               between discharge home and 30-day follow-up. The composite of
               cardiovascular death, stroke, myocardial infarction, all-cause
               readmission, major vascular complications, and new PPM at 30 days
               occurred in 5.7\% patients (n = 6 of 106). Conclusions: SDD
               post-TAVR is safe and feasible in selected patients at low risk
               for adverse clinical events postdischarge. This strategy may have
               a potential role in highly selected patients even when the
               COVID-19 pandemic abates. © 2022 American College of Cardiology

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Essential oils (EOs) are extensively used in swine
               production because of their bioactive action in gut health. In
               addition, some EOs have the potential to reduce waste emission.
               The present study aimed to find an optimal combination of
               carvacrol, thymol and cinnamaldehyde to promote nitrogen
               utilization and reduce waste emission by a model in vitro and an
               animal study. RESULTS: In the study in vitro, various dosages of
               essential oils (EOs) were used to evaluate the effect on nitrogen
               metabolism through a three-step model. Compared with other EO
               combinations, 2EO (10 ppm cinnamaldehyde and 20 ppm thymol), and
               3EO (10 ppm cinnamaldehyde, 20 ppm thymol and 200 ppm carvacrol)
               displayed greater nitrogen digestibility, lesser ammonia
               production and lower activity of microbial enzymes. In the animal
               study, growing male Landrace × Yorkshire pigs (initial body
               weight: 31.8 ± 3.3 kg, n = 18) were randomly divided into three
               groups and fed the control, 2EO or 3EO diet for 4 weeks. Pigs fed
               3EO exhibited the greatest nitrogen digestibility (85.4\%, P <
               0.05). EO supplementation decreased the emission of ammonia
               (130–140 vs. 223 mg g−1) and total fecal nitrogen (8.0–9.9 vs.
               12.4 g d−1) (P < 0.05). Microbial protease and urease activities
               were inhibited by EO treatments (P < 0.01). Both 2EO and 3EO
               reduced the content of indole and 3-methylindole (P < 0.01),
               whereas only 2EO caused a decrease in p-cresol (P < 0.1).
               CONCLUSION: 2EO was suitable for reducing waste emission and
               odorous compounds in growing pigs, whereas 3EO was optimal for
               increasing nitrogen utilization and partially reducing waste
               odorous compounds. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2021

               provides a promising solution for designing a new generation
               lubricants of superior tribological properties. Present work
               addressed the chemically functionalized 2D/2D heterostructure of
               h-BN and MoS2 nanosheets as a dispersible additive to engine oil
               for reducing friction and material losses. The h-BN nanosheets
               prepared by alkali-assisted hydrothermal exfoliation are used for
               growing the MoS2 lamellae via a chemical reduction in the
               presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The XPS, FTIR,
               Raman, XRD, and HRTEM analyses confirmed the synthesis of the
               h-BN-MoS2-CTAB heterostructure. The grafting of CTA furnished
               excellent dispersibility of h-BN-MoS2-CTAB heterostructure in
               fully formulated engine oil, which ensured their uninterrupted
               supply to contact interfaces of steel tribopair. A minute dose of
               h-BN-MoS2-CTAB (30 ppm) to engine oil decreased the friction and
               wear by 44\% and 96\% for steel tribopair. The improved
               lubrication properties are ascribed to the excellent
               dispersibility of h-BN-MoS2-CTAB heterostructure in engine oil,
               low shear strength of incommensurately stacked h-BN and MoS2
               lamellae, and the formation of protective thin film on steel

               hydrometallurgical processing of nickel laterite ores as a source
               of scandium was investigated. The use of an atmospheric leaching
               process was proposed and five different lixiviants, namely
               sulphuric, phosphoric, oxalic, citric and ascorbic acids, were
               examined systematically to extract the scandium. Characterisation
               results showed that the nickel laterite residue sample contained
               about 148 ppm scandium and that the major crystalline phases of
               the sample were quartz, chromite, magnetite and akaganeite.
               Results of the leaching experiments suggested that most of the
               scandium was hosted within the refractory iron-bearing minerals,
               namely magnetite and chromite, based on the apparent correlation
               between the scandium dissolution and iron and chromium
               dissolutions and the composition of crystalline phases in the
               leached residues. Oxalic acid was found to be the most effective
               lixiviant to overcome the refractoriness of these minerals and
               render the scandium accessible for dissolution. To further
               improve the leaching performance with oxalic acid, the effects of
               acid concentration, stirring speed, pulp density, temperature and
               leaching duration on the leaching efficiency were studied. It was

               Different from the previously reported 1D magnetic sensor based
               on the ΔE effect, the anisotropic ΔE effect was used to realize
               in-plane and out-of-plane 2D magnetic field responses on a
               discrete sensor, and the sensor had two readout methods: resonant
               frequency f and return loss S11. The magnetic sensor realized the
               resonant frequency f shifted by 1.03 MHz and 0.2 MHz in the 567
               Oe in-plane magnetic field and 720 Oe out-of-plane magnetic

               cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The aim of
               this study was to evaluate the effects of nitric oxide (NO)
               supplementation to the CPB circuit on the development of cardiac
               surgery–associated AKI. Methods: This prospective randomized
               controlled study included 96 patients with moderate risk of renal
               complications who underwent elective cardiac surgery with CPB.
               The study protocol was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov
               (identifier NCT03527381). Patients were randomly allocated to
               either NO supplementation to the CPB bypass circuit (NO treatment
               group; n = 48) or usual care (control group; n = 48). In the NO
               treatment group, 40-ppm NO was administered during the entire CPB
               period. The primary outcome was the incidence of AKI. Results: NO
               treatment was associated with a significant decrease in AKI
               incidence (10 cases [20.8\%] vs 20 cases [41.6\%] in the control
               group; relative risk, 0.5; 95\% confidence interval, 0.26-0.95; P
               = .023) and a higher median urine output during CPB (2.6 mL/kg/h
               [interquartile range (IQR), 2.1-5.08 mL/kg/h] vs 1.7 mL/kg/h
               [IQR, 0.80-2.50 mL/kg/h]; P = .0002). The median urinary
               neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin level at 4 hours after
               surgery was significantly lower in the NO treatment group (1.12

               NO metabolites were significantly increased at 5 minutes
               postclamping, at 5 minutes after declamping, and at the end of

               with proton-exchange membranes (PEMFCs). The first step of both
               syntheses was to prepare hydrogen molybdenum bronzes (HxMoO3)
               through the addition of Zn powder to acidic solutions containing
               Mo(VI) species. Two types of hydrogen-containing molybdenum
               bronzes were synthesized, namely, red bronze (x≈1.55) and green
               bronze (x≈2.0). The next step was the Pt deposition in a redox
               reaction between HxMoO3 and potassium tetrachloroplatinate
               (K2PtCl4) under open-circuit conditions that resulted in
               composite materials defined by aPt⋅b(HxMoO3). Numerous physical
               methods, including XRD, STEM, SEM, and XPS, were used to
               determine both the composition and structure of the catalysts.
               Platinum clusters were distributed over the surface of
               catalytically active support (HxMoO3) in both cases; however, the
               type of molybdenum bronze used for synthesis affects the size of
               Pt particles. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was used to
               determine the regularities of both adsorbed carbon monoxide
               electrodesorption and dissolved CO electrooxidation. CO-tolerance
               of prepared composites was estimated using H2/100 ppm CO mixture

               CO-tolerant catalysts. The understanding of the origin of the

  abstract  = "Background: This paper aims to reveal an urgent industrial scheme
               for a fast and facile total synthesis of umifenovir (arbidol) (by
               one-pot stages) as an antiviral agent for treating the 2019-nCoV
               virus via inhibiting its viral replication in the human cells. As
               COVID-19 takes thousands of lives all around the world, it seems
               that the medicinal resources would not be enough to supply
               billions of peoples currently living on the planet. Thus, this
               pandemic and its subsequent impacts on the natural order of our
               life would be one of the most important threats against the
               entire human race. Methods: In this project, we have made
               attempts to find an operative approach for synthesizing this
               compound as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), which
               showed it could be effective in inhibiting the newly emerged
               coronavirus. Results: The designed scheme uses relatively cheap
               precursors and contains one pot stage instead of seven
               time-consuming and more costly linear steps. Moreover, safe and
               cheap solvents have been used like water and ethanol, instead of
               toxic ones like methanol and pyridine which could cause rejection
               of the API in the organic volatile impurities (OVI) test of
               pharmacopeia analysis, as well as increase the concern of
               inflammability, explosivity, and carcinogenic properties of those
               common solvents. Conclusion: The most important pharmaceutical
               analytical methods containing OVI test (mainly ethanol (about 171
               ppm) much lower than the limits, by gas chromatography-Flame
               Ionization Detector (GC-FID) instrument), assay content (about
               99.6\% by potentiometric titration), and related purity analysis
               (by high-performance liquid chromatography-Ultraviolet Detector
               (HPLC-UV)) (about 99.8\%) were performed and described to give a

               while the peel and the core, in spite of being high in dietary
               fibre and nutrients, are generally considered to be
               agro-industrial waste. The aim of this research was to evaluate
               the effect that the integrated enzymatic and shear homogenization
               processes have on the physicochemical stability of pineapple base
               suspensions (pulp, core, and peel extract). Initially, an
               enzymatic hydrolysis process was evaluated with a completely
               randomized factorial design. Independent variables: incubation
               time (tinc) (1–4 h) and [enzyme] (0–200 ppm). Dependent
               variables: viscosity (μ) and particle sizes (D[3;2] and D[4;3]).
               The results showed a reduction of (μ) (70.7\%), D[3;2] (54.2\%),

               enzyme). The effect of the integrated enzymatic treatment with a
               serial homogenization process was subsequently evaluated.
               Independent variables: high-speed homogenization time (t1) (15–20
               min), recirculation time in high pressure homogenizer (t2) (3–7

               and groups II and III received 50 and 100 ppm fluoride in tap

               levels of fluoride in plasma, brain, and bones was observed in
               rats. Significant (P < 0.05) alterations in levels of total

               aggregation and stress response. However, their role in
               responding to nanoparticles (NPs) has not yet been explained. We

               of HSPB1, HSPB5, HSPB8, and HSPB9 in cerebral tissue. Two
               hundred-ten fertilized eggs were randomly divided into seven
               groups (30 eggs/group; 10 eggs/replicate). Three groups received
               100 ppm, 250 ppm, and 500 ppm of Fe2O3-NPs, respectively. Three
               other groups received 100 ppm, 250 ppm, and 500 ppm of Fe3O4-NPs,
               respectively, and one group remained untreated as a control. The
               NPs were given by in ovo method (0.3 ml/egg) only once on the
               first day of the embryonic period. Samples from cerebrums were
               collected on day 20 for gene expression analyses. HSPB1, HSPB5,
               HSPB8, and HSPB9 were all expressed in both normal and IONPs
               exposed cerebrums. SHSPs tested were differentially expressed in
               response to various concentrations of IONPs. The highest
               expression levels in response to Fe2O3-NPs and Fe3O4-NPs were
               observed for HSPB5 and HSPB9, respectively. The greatest gene
               expression changes due to the Fe2O3-NPs and Fe3O4-NPs exposure
               observed for HSPB1 and HSPB5, respectively. The results suggest a
               protective cellular mechanism against IONPs through SHSPs and

               and maximum (394.75 ± 0.34 ppm) mean of Xco2 was observed in the
               first quarter of 2015 and third quarter of 2017. The Xco2
               obtained negative correlations with the SIF (−0.81), LAI (−0.81),

               Xco2 tend to vary over the years. We conclude that the temporal
               variation of Xco2 above sugarcane areas in southern Brazil is
               well represented by a periodic function. Our results indicate
               photosynthesis and soil exposure after harvest are factors that

               frother concentration range of 10 to 50 ppm. The response surface
               methodology was used for the experimental test runs. The results

               98,39\% at 1,28 kg of collector/ton of coal and 40 ppm of frother

  abstract  = "Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia L.) belongs to family
               Cucurbitaceae, and is a popular vegetable crop in the tropical
               and sub-tropical countries. It is an annually grown herbaceous
               vine that requires warm climate for growth. The leaves, stem and
               roots of bitter gourd contains a lot of bio-active components
               having nutritional and medicinal importance. Alternaria leaf
               blight (Alternaria cucumerina Ellis \& Everh.) is a fungus which
               causes leaf blight on bitter gourd and leads to significant crop
               damage. The present study investigated the efficacy of five
               different fungicides against Alternaria leaf blight (ALB) of
               bitter gourd under in vivo and in vitro conditions. The single
               hyphal tip method was used to isolate and purify the fungal
               pathogen from the ALB infected leaves of bitter gourd. Five
               commercially available fungicides (1. Melody duo 66.8\% WP, 2.
               Polyram DF 70\%, 3. Score 250 EC, 4. Tilt 250 EC, 5. Flumax 60\%
               EC) were evaluated at concentrations of 50 ppm and 100 ppm for
               effective ALB diseased control. Among tested fungicides, maximum
               inhibition (90 \%) of fungal growth was given by Melody duo @ 100
               ppm concentration followed by Polyram (81 \%), Score (77 \%) and
               Tilt (70 \%), whereas Flumax resulted in minimum (45 \%) fungal

               8\%-Cu-8\%-Mg/RH550 when assessed in terms of 10\% breakthrough
               volume (3 L atm g−1). The corresponding values for reference
               materials (e.g., RH550, 16\%-Cu/RH550, and 16\%-Mg/RH550) were
               0.4, 1.1, and 0.5 L atm g−1, respectively. Adsorption kinetic
               models confirmed the synergistic roles of physicochemical

               material (both organic (RH550) and inorganic (metal oxides)

               velocity of 2,229 h−1). The oxidation reaction of FA is expedited
               by the partial reduction of copper(II) oxide (in Cu-Mg/RH550) to
               copper(I) oxide. According to the density functional theory-based

               the adsorbed FA molecules. The Cu-Mg synergy also enhances the
               capture and activation of molecular oxygen (O2) to boost FA
               oxidation while sustaining the catalytic process. Overall, this

               Perovskite quantum dots have been recently emerging as a
               potentially relevant material because of their outstanding
               optoelectronic properties; however, some issues regarding
               instability and environmental impact remains as stumbling blocks.
               This research presents a promising and facile method for
               incorporating lead toxicity reduced inorganic perovskite quantum
               dots (IPQDs; CsPb0.25Zn0.75I3) with eco-friendly cellulose
               nanocrystal (CNC) ligands into polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
               electrospun nanofibers (PPNG) forming potential piezoelectric and
               pyroelectric applications. Applying distinct pressures through
               finger tapping, air pressure, hand bending, fist beating, and
               foot striking generates intriguing self-powered energy harvesting
               sensory performances. PPNG produces stable and sensitive signals
               with highest open-circuit voltage of 20.3 V, short circuit
               current of 1.2 μA cm−2, and power density of 29.0 μW cm−3.
               Furthermore, the material was found to be successful in
               pyrocatalytic decay of Rhodamine-B dye; the maximum dye decay was
               91\% and it exhibits five reusable cycles with ultra-low lead
               leakages (<1 ppm) because of the photo thermal property of the
               IPQDs, and excellent stability offered by dual encapsulation. The
               wearable and durable performances exhibited by the PPNGs can

               promising approach for natural gas storage and transportation.
               One challenge of this technology is to enhance the hydrate
               formation kinetics and achieve mild storage conditions. This work
               employed a biomass surfactant sulfonated lignin (SL) to enhance
               CH4 hydrate formation. Meanwhile, the self-preservation effect of
               CH4 hydrate formed in the presence of SL was investigated using a
               high-pressure micro-differential scanning calorimeter (HP μ-DSC).
               The results indicate that 500 ppm SL is an optimum concentration
               for improving CH4 hydrate formation kinetics among the five SL
               concentrations (300, 500, 700, 900, and 1000 ppm) tested. At 500
               ppm SL, the CH4 hydrate formation rate was increased
               significantly, and the largest gas consumption was obtained,
               which was 2.7 times larger than that obtained in pure water under
               the same temperature and pressure conditions. The gas consumption
               was also larger than that obtained in the presence of other
               surfactants (sodium dodecyl sulfate, silicone surfactant, and
               ethylene diamine tetraacetamide). CH4 hydrate formed in the
               presence of SL can be stably preserved at 0.1 MPa and 268.15 K
               due to the self-preservation effect. Therefore, the energy costs,
               such as system cooling and gas compression, for SNG using SL are
               lower than conventional natural gas storage and transport

               blending of biodiesel into conventional diesel fuel drops the

               buffer, and catalyst the chemical reactions until the combustion
               process. Accordingly, GO ensures more complete combustion, and
               therefore reduces CO emission by 22.5\% and HC emission by
               30.23\%. In the conclusion, the present paper declares that GO

               mineral in the past, the Ayurvedic practitioner adopted a
               critical and tedious procedure for the preparation of
               Rasasindura. Therefore, it is essential to understand the
               Ayurvedic process in the perspective of material science.
               Further, a toxicity study is also required as mercury is the main
               component in Rasasindura. Here, in the present study, we
               characterized Rasasindura and one of its intermediates (Kajjali)
               to understand the physicochemical changes that occur in the
               Ayurvedic process. Furthermore, we have assessed the toxicity of
               Kajjali and Rasasindura in NIH3T3 cell lines and zebrafish
               larvae. XRD analysis of Rasasindura confirms it as a highly pure
               α-HgS with size ranges from nano to micron sizes (starting from
               ∼80 nm). Whereas, Kajjali is a β-HgS having lower size ranges

               cytotoxicity on NIH3T3 cell line up to 75 ppm, whereas for
               Kajjali, cytotoxicity was observed above 20 ppm. The higher
               toxicity of Kajjali is due to higher penetration of particles
               into the cells. However, in zebrafish larvae, even at too high
               concentrations (1000 ppm), both Rasasindura and Kajjali did not

               amplitude during free vibrational decay after tone-burst
               excitation. The technique differs from previous nonlinear
               reverberation spectroscopy (NRS) techniques in that it employs
               phase-sensitive superheterodyne reception. Time-dependent
               amplitudes of in-phase and out-of-phase components of signals,
               relative to a reference sinusoid at the excitation frequency, are
               provided through analog hardware processing in the absence of
               digitization of the signal from the vibrational sensor. The
               time-dependent phase and amplitude of the signal are determined
               through software analysis of these in-phase and out-of-phase
               components, and the instantaneous frequency during free decay is
               then determined from the time derivative of the phase. With this
               approach, superheterodyne reception and low-pass filtering of the
               phase-detector outputs lead to a great reduction in noise and
               computation effort, relative to direct digitization and software
               processing of the sensor signal, while retaining information on
               frequency shifts on a relevant time scale during ringdown. As
               with other NRS techniques, rapid acquisition of data on amplitude
               dependence of the resonant frequency during ringdown leads to
               minimization of systematic errors from temperature drift. The

               detached from the quartz confinement tube and goes blow-off when
               the equivalence ratio drops below approximately 0.7–0.8. Then, to
               alleviate the problem of low flammability, gliding arc discharges
               driven by a 12.5 kHz alternating current (AC) power supply are
               facilitated to extend the lean blow-off margin to approximately
               0.3–0.4. The localized flame kernels surrounding the discharge
               column are detected by high-speed photography. The planar
               laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) imaging of OH radicals, optical
               emission spectroscopy, and NH2* chemiluminescence measurement are
               performed to interpret the intermediate chemistry. Finally, the
               NOx emission of the swirling ammonia/air flame is measured by a
               flue gas analyzer. Results show that although the AC-powered
               gliding arc exhibits weak global effects on the NOx reduction of
               burner-stabilized ammonia/air flames prevailing at higher
               equivalence ratios (e.g., φ > 0.75), leaner flames stabilized by
               discharges can achieve NOx emissions below 100 ppm due to the

               shown promise as an effective wastewater treatment protocol.
               Magnetic CoFe2O4/Ag-nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on
               functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (fMWCNTs), a support
               material, were synthesized using a one-pot solvothermal method.
               The surface morphologies and physicochemical properties of the
               CoFe2O4/Ag-fMWCNT hybrid nanocomposite catalyst were investigated
               by powder X-ray diffraction analysis, field-emission scanning
               electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy,
               high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Fourier
               transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron
               spectroscopy, and nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms. The
               activity of the nanocomposite combined with PMS (serving as an
               activator) toward the degradation of rhodamine B, methylene blue,
               methyl orange, and methyl red was investigated. The obtained
               optimal 0.02 g CoFe2O4/Ag-fMWCNTs exhibited the highest PMS
               activation performance, with a removal percentage of 100\% for 20
               ppm dye concentration at pH 6.5 within 14 min. In addition, the
               rhodamine B degradation product was investigated by analyzing the
               intermediate products by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry
               (LC–MS). The homogeneous distribution of CoFe2O4/Ag NPs on
               fMWCNTs accelerated PMS activation and enhanced the catalytic
               degradation of dyes. The effects of the reaction parameters on
               the dye degradation efficiency were investigated by using
               different nanocatalysts (fMWCNTs, CoFe2O4/fMWCNTs, and
               CoFe2O4/Ag-fMWCNTs) as well as by varying the pH (3–11), dye
               concentration (10–50 mg/l), catalyst dose (0.002–0.3 g), and PMS
               dose (0.02–0.1 g). Quenching experiments revealed that sulfate
               radicals are primarily responsible for rhodamine B degradation. A
               plausible mechanism for catalytic PMS activation was also
               proposed. Complete decolorization occurred within the first few
               minutes of the reaction. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of
               the CoFe2O4/Ag-fMWCNT/PMS hybrid nanocomposite remained stable
               after five successive cycles. This study verifies the
               applicability of CoFe2O4/Ag-fMWCNTs as an ultrafast catalyst for
               the complete removal of persistent organic pollutants via PMS

               in the field of advanced oxidation, but their serious
               agglomeration and slow catalytic efficiency are still the
               stumbling blocks. The composite catalyst (EG-CuFe2O4-U) prepared

               as the substrate immobilized CuFe2O4 not only exposed more active
               sites but also exhibited a higher electron transfer rate.
               Additionally, EG-CuFe2O4-U showed excellent performance in
               degrading tetracycline (TC) in model wastewater by activated
               peroxydisulfate (PDS). The synthesis mechanism of EG-CuFe2O4-U
               and the principle of urea in the formation of reduction
               environment were discussed in detail by the experimental results
               of key preparation parameters and characterization. Meanwhile,
               several critical influencing factors were examined including PDS
               concentration, catalyst dosage, initial pH of the solution, and
               the change of pH in different systems. Furthermore, the removal
               efficiency and mineralization efficiency of TC (50 ppm) exceed
               91\% and 34.6\%, on the conditions of 0.4 gL−1 EG-CuFe2O4-U, 6 mM

               the internal reaction mechanism of free radicals and non-free
               radicals in the EG-CuFe2O4-U/PDS system was further elaborated

               Finally, based on twenty-one principal intermediates of TC, four

               ventilation inside the vehicles and proposing actions to improve
               it. The results show that CO2 concentrations (1039 and 934 ± 386
               ppm, as average and median, during rush hours but with average
               reduced occupancy due to the fair to be infected by SARS-CoV-2
               during the measurement period, and measured in the middle of the
               busses) are in the lower range of values recorded in the
               literature for public buses, however an improvement in
               ventilation is required in a significant proportion of the
               journeys. Thus, we found better ventilation in the older Euro 3+
               (retrofitted with filter traps and selective catalytic reduction)
               and Euro 5 buses (average 918 ± 257 ppm) than in the hermetically
               closed new Euro 6 ones (1111 ± 432 ppm). The opening of the
               windows in the older buses yielded higher ventilation rates (778
               ± 432 ppm). The opening of all doors at all stops increases the
               ventilation by causing a fall in concentrations of 200–350 ppm
               below inter-stop concentrations, with this effect typically
               lasting 40–50 s in the hermetically closed new Euro 6 hybrid
               buses. Based on these results a number of recommendations are
               offered in order to improve ventilation, including measurement of
               CO2 and occupancy, and installation of ventilation fans on the
               top of the hermetically closed new buses, introducing outdoor air
               when a given concentration threshold is exceeded. In these cases,
               a CO2 sensor installed in the outdoor air intake is also
               recommended to take into account external CO2 contributions. ©

               sensing has been investigated widely. Conventional
               wavelength-modulation spectroscopy (WMS) in TDLAS usually
               involves linear triangle patterns for tunable laser scanning.
               Here, a novel modified laser scanning technique is proposed and
               experimentally demonstrated in the WMS-based TDLAS gas sensor.
               The half-wave scan is primarily introduced to drive the laser
               diode to cover 1/2 range of the Lorentz-like gas absorption line.
               By monitoring waveform derivation of second harmonics, real-time
               status of the laser output could be exhibited and the output
               wavelength constancy can be controlled. It is also verified that
               second harmonics feature basically linearly with wavelength
               drifts, allowing the in-situ regulation of laser wavelength
               stability. Moreover, the nonlinear half-wave scan is introduced
               and designs a nonlinear function across the scanning pattern. It
               enlarges the temporal window around strong absorption and
               consequently acquires additional valuable waveform data. With the
               limited sampling rate for TDLAS signal processing, by using the
               nonlinear half-wave scan, second harmonics fluctuate merely 1/3
               of that in the conventional WMS-2f linear scan. The proposed
               modified laser scanning technique is employed in a methane
               sensor, realizing about 3 ppm minimum detection limit and 9.6 ppm
               measurement accuracy. This technique is beneficial and universal
               for real-time monitoring and in-situ control of laser sources and

               Typically, Nbs are captured by affinity chromatography via the
               addition of specific fusion tags at their N or C terminus. Nerve
               growth factor (NGF), which regulates the growth and development

               and plays a key role in both arthritis and acute and chronic
               pain. In this study, a method for capture and purification of an
               untagged Nb (anti-NGF Nb) by mixed weak cation chromatography and
               cation exchange chromatography was established. First, pH 4.0–5.0
               was demonstrated to be the optimal loading condition for Capto
               MMC to capture anti-NGF by the design of experiments (DOE).
               Furthermore, high purity and yield products can be obtained at
               laboratory scale and commercial production scale by adjusting the
               protein pH. Additionally, direct capture of anti-NGF Nb using
               Capto MMC without adjusting anti-NGF Nb harvest pH was
               investigated. The anti-NGF Nb captured by Capto MMC was 67.2\%
               yield, 94.5\% monomer purity, and host cell protein (HCP) was
               reduced from 74,931 ppm to 484 ppm. The anti-NGF Nb that were
               further purified using Capto S ImpAct achieved 84.5\% yield and
               99.2\% purity and 77 ppm of HCP. The scaling-up process was
               consistent with the results of the optimized process, further
               demonstrating the feasibility of this method. This outcome
               provides a highly promising and competitive alternative to

               method as a sensitive electrode, which was intended to detect the
               low-level concentration of SO2 in the environment. After the
               aging process and continuous testing, it was found that the
               LaNiTiO3-SE sensor had the best response value of −27.5 mV to 5
               ppm SO2 at 510 °C, at this temperature, as low as 50 ppb SO2
               still had a response of -1mV. Meanwhile, when the sensor was
               tested at 510 °C, it was found that the response value of the
               sensor showed a piecewise linear relationship with the logarithm
               of SO2 concentration, with a sensitivity of -4 mV/decade for
               0.05–1 ppm SO2 and -40mV/decade for 1–100 ppm SO2. In addition,
               the sensor also showed good selectivity, and the response to
               interference gases could be ignored such as NO2, CO, CH4, NH3,
               H2, ethanol, and formaldehyde. At the same time, the sensor also
               shows good repeatability and stability, being still relatively
               stable after two weeks of continuous operation at
               high-temperature. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",

               to use a single SPAD receiver to achieve underwater wireless

               The feasibility is theoretically analyzed, and firstly
               demonstrated in a proof-of-concept orthogonal frequency division

               quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) and 16 quadrature amplitude
               modulation (16-QAM) can work with less than 68 and 390 photons

               When D. vulgaris was cultured in more nutritional medium, more
               H2S was generated and more serious corrosion of Cu occurred. The
               concentration of H2S corresponding to the medium with total
               nutrition was as high as 4.9 × 104(±913.0) ppm. The weight loss

               trichlorosilane (OTS), AT-APTES, AT-APTES-STA and AT-OTS
               nanoparticle demulsifiers were prepared. The structure and
               morphology of the prepared materials were characterized and
               analyzed by FT-IR, SEM and Zeta potential. Contact angle
               characterization and the distribution of nanoparticle materials
               in the oil-water mixture showed that the AT-APTES-STA
               nanomaterial has good amphiphilicity and interfacial activity.
               The demulsification performance of various NP demulsifiers was
               investigated by using bottle test method. The results showed that
               the AT-APTES-STA nanoparticles can achieve rapid and efficient
               demulsification of the crude oil emulsions at room temperature in
               a wide pH range from acidic to weak alkaline. The increase of
               demulsifier dosage and demulsification temperature was helpful to
               improve the demulsification efficieny. However, the influence of
               temperature on the demulsification efficiency was limited, and
               good demulsification efficiency could be obtained at room
               temperature. Under the conditions of demulsifier dosage 900 ppm,
               pH 7 and temperature 25℃, the demulsification efficiency of
               AT-APTES-STA was as high as 96.7\%. In contrast, the AT-APTES had
               a poor demulsification efficiency, while the AT and AT-OTS
               materials basically do not have the demulsification ability. By
               comparing the demulsification performance and the chemical
               structure of these modified attapulgite nanoparticles, it was
               concluded that a NP demulsifier with excellent demulsification
               performance should have the following two basic characteristics:
               (a) good amphiphilicity and interfacial activity; and (b) enough
               surface functional groups that can strongly interact with the
               emulsified molecules. It is believed that this work is of great
               significance to the design and preparation of NP demulsifiers for

               fuel operating mode in a direct injection diesel engine. However,
               there is not sufficient information about using modified fuels
               with biogas. This study aimed to investigate the effects of
               modified diesel fuel and biogas on combustion behavior,
               performance, and emissions characteristics at 1500 rpm constant
               speed with 5 different load conditions at an interval of 25\%.
               Diesel was modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes with 30,
               60, and 90 ppm. Diesel fuel and three modified fuels were used as
               pilot fuel and biogas was introduced through the intake manifold
               with the flow rate of 500 g/h as the primary fuel. Diesel mode
               fuels were denominated F1 while dual fuel mode fuels were labeled
               as F2, and the concentration levels were given subscript such as
               F2 @60ppm. The experimental study revealed that modified fuel
               showed better combustion behaviors, performance, and emissions in
               comparison to diesel fuel. Further, the same trend was observed
               in the dual fuel mode. The maximum pressure of F2 @60 ppm was 1\%
               higher than F2 under dual fuel mode at the full load. Moreover,
               the coefficient of variation of the indicated mean effective
               pressure for dual fuel mode was found approximately 9.2, 6.9,
               6.2, and 7.2\% for F2, F2 @30 ppm, F2 @60 ppm, and F2 @90 ppm,
               respectively at full load. In addition, the energy share of
               biogas increased by 7.9, 8.7, and 7.1\% for F2 @30 ppm, F2 @60
               ppm, and F2 @90 ppm, respectively in comparison with F2 at full
               load. The highest decrease of brake specific energy consumption
               under the dual mode was obtained to be an 8\% drop from F2 @60
               ppm compared to F2 at full load. At the same load, the brake
               thermal efficiency of F2 @30 ppm, F2 @60 ppm, and F2 @90 ppm were
               noted to be 30.2, 30.4, and 30.0\%, respectively which are higher
               than F2 (27.9\%). The value of replaced diesel with biogas was
               noted 0.09, 0.23, 0.24, and 0.22 kg/h for F2, F2 @30 ppm, F2 @60
               ppm, and F2 @90 ppm, respectively under the full load condition.
               Lastly, CO and HC emissions were almost the same value with and
               without modified fuel for dual fuel mode at the full load.
               Nevertheless, NO emission was slightly increased with modified
               fuel compared to F2. From these findings, it can be suggested
               that 60 ppm multi-walled carbon nanotubes additive can be an
               optimum level for combustion, performance, and emissions under

               cause environmental pollution in recent decades. An elevated
               concentration of these heavy metals is highly toxic to plant.
               Chromium (Cr) is one of the heavy metals whose concentration in
               the environment is still increasing alarmingly. It is harmful for
               plant growth and achene yield. To check out the growth and
               protein alternation towards pollutants, two sunflower varieties
               (RA-713 and AHO-33) were subjected to different chromium
               concentrations (control, 200 ppm, 400 ppm) by soil application.
               This study has elaborated that 400 ppm Cr resulted in a reduction
               of various growth parameters. Sodium dodecyl sulphate
               polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to enhance
               the understanding of plant proteomic modulation under Cr stress.
               Different protein bands like 48 and 49, 26 kDa have newly
               appeared, and three 60, 47, and 42 kDa, and two protein bands 49
               and 13 kDa were up-regulated in seeds of RA-713 and AHO-33,
               respectively. Some proteins (52, 16 kDa) are down-regulated in
               leaf tissues of both varieties. Only 6 and 81 kDa protein showed
               up-regulation and 154 kDa down-regulation behavior in the shoot
               in response to stress. The finding s of study might support the

               low-cost technologies for obtaining purified water throughout the
               year. The inevitable problem associated with RBF is clogging, a
               complex phenomenon that obstructs the flow. The present study
               conducted laboratory experiments on two different filter
               materials (uniformly graded) collected from the Ganges River bed
               from an RBF site in Haridwar. The primary focus is to study the
               factors influencing the clogging mechanism that affects the
               hydraulic conductivity, K of the filter material. The variation
               in the piezometric head, porosity, specific infiltration
               resistance, and the progressive clogging of the filter material
               is studied considering the experimental results. It is observed
               that the retention and intrusion of suspended particles depend on
               the grain size of filter material and fine sediments. The
               clogging of pores is more at the initial depths (2-7.5 cm),
               demonstrating the phenomenon of physical clogging. For every
               experimental run performed, as time progressed, with increased
               resistance and head difference, K and porosity of the filter
               materials decreased (Filter material-1, 47.17\% and 48\%; Filter
               material-2, 93.43\% and 81\%). With an increase in initial
               discharge, q0, K is partially recovered, presenting the initial
               desiltation process. Further, as time elapsed and with an
               increase in the turbidity, C, from 500 to 1,000 ppm, the clogging
               advanced resulting in decreased K of the filter materials.
               Therefore, taken as a whole, the ratio of mean size of filter
               material to suspended particles, q0, C, and time are considered
               as the dominant factors influencing the clogging process.
               Mathematical regression models for both the filter materials are
               formulated and found to estimate K reliably. The correlation
               coefficients calculated for both the models at a 95\% confidence
               level are 0.814 and 0.965, respectively, and are statistically
               significant, presenting the functional dependency of K on the
               ascertained parameters as acceptable. © 2021 American Society of

               a dip-coating process to produce a solar absorber. The solar
               driven seawater desalination setup was made up of i) solar
               absorber where heat was localized and the evaporation occurs, ii)
               thermal insulation using polystyrene foam and air gap to minimize
               the heat loss, and iii) water pathway for continuous supply of
               seawater to the solar absorber. Carbonized sawdust/barium
               titanate composite solar absorber was tested under direct solar
               radiation for about 2 h using seawater collected from the beach
               coast of Universiti Malaysia Sabah, where it was repeated three
               times to observe the stability of the solar absorber. The average
               efficiency of the carbonized sawdust/barium titanate composite
               solar absorber was about 72.04\% with average evaporation rate of
               1.32 kg/m2 h. Salinity of the clean water was significantly
               reduced about 99.8\% from the initial seawater salinity at 29300
               ppm to 50 ppm, and the pH value was observed at 7.40. The
               salinity and pH value of the generated clean water was within the
               safe water limit based on the World Health Organization (WHO)

               efficient method to improve the performance of reverse osmosis
               (RO) membranes. The conventional soaking of RO membranes in
               alkaline sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) usually promotes extensive
               hydrolysis and cleavage amide bonds, resulting in improved water
               flux but declined salt rejection. Here, alcohols were added into
               the NaClO solution to regulate the chlorination processes using
               their “swelling-fastening” effect. The alcohols could interact
               with polyamide chains, and thus swell the polyamide network. Due
               to this interaction, the NaClO has less probability of attacking
               the polyamide chains. Hence, the chlorine-promoted hydrolysis was
               partly eased, which could weaken the decrease of salt rejection.
               Besides, after removing alcohols as well as the dissolved small
               oligomers and fragments of polyamide, the network was compacted
               and the loosened sites were healed, which is also beneficial to
               increase the difficulty of salt penetration. The treatment of RO
               membrane by the NaClO and alcohols could produce a hydrophilic
               surface with increased water flux and high salt rejection. The
               membrane chloridized at 2000 ppm NaClO exhibited a water flux

               biocarrier for coal bio-desulphurization coupled with rapid

               shortly emerged as rapid coal treatment device as it removed CO2

               NH4+ (0.08 kg/m3/day), NO3– (0.05 kg/m3/day), and PO43- (0.01
               kg/m3/day). Super-high CO2 fixation along with high sulphur
               removal rate (43.3 kg/m3/day) also yielded 400 mol/h/g protein.
               That further provided ample supply of HCO3–, S2O32- and SO42-
               species to microbes, which ultimately resulted in highly dense
               microbial ecosystem (14 g/L/h). Highest coal treatment efficiency
               (90\%) was recorded, at sulphur/CO2 ratio of 20 and 14-h
               residence time, which was 30 times better performance than

               dissolution in oil through the CO2-saturated aqueous phase.
               Therefore, low CO2-aqueous phase IFT values are related to
               improvements in the oil recovery. However, the literature is
               still absent of simple and accurate models for IFT of
               CO2-water-electrolyte systems at reservoir temperature, water
               salinity and high pressure. Aiming to fill this gap, this work
               employed IFT data from the literature to present novel empirical
               and semiempirical correlations to calculate the IFT of these
               systems as a function of the phase densities at reservoir
               conditions, including the atypical conditions of high pressure
               and salinity of Brazilian Pre-Salt basin. The strategies proposed
               to model the phase densities when modeling the IFT through
               empirical and semiempirical equations are unprecedented in the
               literature and produced quite promising results. The results
               indicate that the proposed empirical equations can predict the
               CO2-water IFT with overall absolute deviations up to 6\% over
               pressures between 0.1 and 45 MPa and temperatures between 30 and
               75 °C. For CO2-brine systems, the proposed semiempirical equation
               provided an overall absolute deviation lower than 8\% for brines
               composed of only NaCl, both NaCl and CaCl2 and only CaCl2 over 2
               to 45 MPa, 40 to 75.5 °C and salinities up to 356,872 ppm. The
               accuracy of the proposed correlations is higher than those of the
               Parachor model, usually employed in commercial reservoir
               simulators. Also, they need lower computational efforts and can
               be advantageous for simulations purposes. © 2021",

               low-temperature detection of hazardous gases (e.g.,
               triethylamine, TEA) is highly desirable, but still challenging.
               Herein, a self-template synthesis strategy for mesoporous Au-SnO2
               nanospheres was developed using nontoxic, renewable and low-cost
               plant polyphenol as a main chelating agent, tin ions and
               chloroauric acid as a metal source. Because of the strong chelate
               ability of polyphenol, a stable Au/tin-polyphenol-formaldehyde
               sphere is obtained and used as a precursor. After direct
               calcination process, Au-SnO2 materials with mesoporous
               crystalline framework, uniform diameter (~120 nm) and high
               specific surface area (105.2 m2/g) are successfully prepared. The
               mesoporous Au-SnO2 nanospheres are further used for TEA sensing.
               They show high response (5.16) at a low temperature (50 ℃) toward
               TEA. The detection limit was 0.11 ppm. The decoration of Au
               species can effectively decrease the activation energy and lower
               the working temperature. After integration with Bluetooth, the
               gas sensor can be used for wireless monitoring TEA with a low
               concentration (10–50 ppm) and fast response (~ 30 s). This
               proposed strategy can be used for mesoporous noble metal-metal
               oxides and further boost the sensing performance of gas sensor. ©

               composition, salinity, pH and the presence of iron ions. The
               measured apparent hydrodynamic size and zeta potential indicate
               that nanoparticles remain dispersed with the expected size only
               for salinity below 3000 ppm with pH ranges 6.5 to 8.5. For higher
               salinity or pH outside that range or presence of iron ions,
               agglomeration becomes strong. Core flood experiments are
               conducted on high permeability Bentheimer sandstone, and the
               transport and retention of nanoparticles in the cores was
               analysed using multiple pressures measured along the core and by
               influent/effluent analysis. Core flood results show that stable
               injectivity can be reached with a good propagation of the
               nanoparticles through the permeable core with no external filter
               cake formation, provided the pH and salinity of the injected
               fluid are kept within the dispersion range and free of iron ions.
               However, injectivity decline still occurs in three characteristic
               stages well captured by our mechanistic model used to match the
               data. This study will contribute to better understanding of the
               transport dynamics of nanoparticles in the subsurface and to
               better modelling prediction and assessment of technologies where
               transport of nanoparticles is key. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",

  abstract  = "The petroleum fuel demand with high price and its exhaustion
               imposes a pressure to find an alternative. The fossil fuel
               shortage has been deteriorating over the past few years, because
               of the rapid increase in population. Many attempts have been made
               to increase the quality of biofuel with additives. In this paper,
               two types of nanoparticles such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) and
               alumina (Al2O3) in chlorella microalgae biofuel were analyzed by
               experimental method. The added CNT and alumina act as a catalyst
               that induces complete combustion with retarded emissions. In
               addition to above, the noise and vibration qualities are also
               measured. A series of test conducted using single cylinders, four
               stroke, naturally aspirated compression ignition diesel engine
               was run by using pure diesel and also different fuel blends ‘such
               as B10CNT50A50 Chlorella (Microalgae Biodiesel 10\% + Diesel 90\%
               + CNT 50 ppm), B20CNT50A50 (Microalgae Biodiesel 20\% + Diesel
               80\% + CNT 50 ppm + Al2O3 50 ppm) and B30CNT50A50 (Microalgae
               Biodiesel 30\% + Diesel 70\% + CNT 50 ppm + Al2O3 50 ppm). At a
               constant load condition, all experimental tests were conducted at
               four different speeds such as 1500 rpm, 2000 rpm, 2500 rpm and
               3000 rpm. The reference fuel of diesel B0 results was compared
               with blended fuel. From the results, it has been found that the
               nano additives of CNT and alumina reduced the greenhouse gas
               emissions of CO compared to plain diesel. Only considering the
               blended fuel, as the percentage of biofuel increases, the
               emission of nitric oxide and carbon dioxide is decreased with
               significant reduction in the amount of noise and vibration and
               also the combustion and performance qualities were also improved.
               The highest benefit in terms of all factors was achieved in the
               fuel blend of B30A50CNT50 amongst the other blends. © 2022

               investigate in-vitro antioxidant, standardize quality parameters,
               study acute toxicity, and determine in-vivo anti-inflammatory.
               Three spectrophotometric methods were used to determine
               antioxidant activity. The standardization includes physical,
               chemical, and microbiological evaluation. Furthermore, an acute
               toxicity test was conducted using 20 female Sprague Dawley (SD)
               strain rats divided into 4 groups with different dose of
               propolis. The in vivo anti-inflammatory test was carried out
               using the carrageenan induction method on rats' soles. A total of
               36 female SD rats were classified into 6 groups as follows, Group
               normal, negative control, diclofenac sodium, and three propolis
               groups (72; 144; and 288 mg/kg BW). The results demonstrated the
               IC50 values of the DPPH and ABTS scavenging activity 9.694 ppm
               and 2.213 ppm, respectively. The FRAP reducing power was 189.05
               mg AaE/g. The physical appearance of propolis capsule was
               vegicaps as white – white, size 0, with light brown granule.
               Moreover, the content weight was 418.88 mg with a disintegration
               time of 7 min 53 s, while the water, flavonoid, and polyphenol
               contents were 9.07\%, 1.59\%, and 98.0821 mg GAE/g respectively.
               The content of heavy metal and microbial contamination were not
               detected. The acute toxicity results showed LD50 ≥ 5 g/kg BW, no
               toxicity symptoms, and no abnormalities in all rats. The
               anti-inflammatory inhibition percentage for groups III, IV, V,
               and VI was 11.86\%, 6.53\%, 7.81\%, and 6.63\% respectively,

  abstract  = "Since the construction of the first commercial nuclear power
               plant in 1957, the nuclear power industry has operated under the
               philosophy of economy of scale - the idea that increased power
               plant size accounts for higher economic efficiency. However,
               there has been a recent shift in direction; small modular
               reactors (SMRs) and micro-reactors are being considered as
               potentially wise investments for commercial power producers in
               that they can provide advantages that large-scale reactors may
               not possess in terms of reactor safety and investment risk.
               However, this may come at the risk of a higher levelized cost of
               electricity (LCOE). LCOE may be reduced by enriching the fuel
               passed its regulated limit of 5 wt\% (w/o) 235U. The high assay
               low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel (5–20 w/o 235U) is introduced
               to increase the plant capacity factor, which thereby decrease
               fuel supply costs and reduce the LCOE. While decreasing plant
               LCOE seems like a clear advantage, several issues may result from
               increasing enrichments to the HALEU level in an SMR or
               micro-reactor design. This paper aims to shed light on these
               issues and address how they may affect the overall reactor design
               by using HALEU fuels in these reactors. This paper first
               discusses the notable effects on a reactor design with higher
               enrichment, then analyzes a SMR case study based on the NuScale's
               160 MWth SMR design. The case study reveals that the SMR with
               higher enriched fuel was able to double both fuel burnup and
               cycle time with an average core enrichment of 8.34 w/o and a
               maximum average assembly enrichment of 9.10 w/o. Moreover, this
               higher enriched core was found to operate with a maximum global
               peaking factor of 1.86, well below the published limit of 2.0.
               Likewise, the maximum axial flux offset of −2.4\% and the maximum
               boron concentration of 1757 ppm both remain within their
               respective safety constraints. Notable fission poisons, such as
               149Sm and 135Xe, were also found to sharply increase in the HALEU
               core. Additionally, the average fuel temperature and peak
               cladding temperature fell within their respective safety
               constraints. Core-averaged flux, fluence, cladding creep, and
               post-shutdown decay heat were also investigated. Lastly, the
               higher enriched core was found to reduce LCOE by approximately

               immunity by orchestrating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
               hormone-dependent signalling pathways. The present work focuses
               on the specific case of fatty acid hydroperoxides (HPOs).
               Although some studies report their potential use as exogenous
               biocontrol agents for plant protection, evaluation of their
               efficiency in planta is lacking and no information is available
               about their mechanism of action. In this study, the potential of
               13(S)-hydroperoxy-(9Z, 11E)-octadecadienoic acid (13-HPOD) and
               13(S)-hydroperoxy-(9Z, 11E, 15Z)-octadecatrienoic acid (13-HPOT),

               cinerea was observed after root application with HPOs. They also
               activate early immunity-related defence responses, like ROS. As
               previous studies have demonstrated their ability to interact with
               plant plasma membranes (PPM), we have further investigated the
               effects of HPOs on biomimetic PPM structure using complementary
               biophysics tools. Results show that HPO insertion into PPM
               impacts its global structure without solubilizing it. The
               relationship between biological assays and biophysical analysis
               suggests that lipid amphiphilic elicitors that directly act on

               provides insights into the effects of various operating
               conditions on the separation characteristics of polysulfone
               membranes. The experiments to determine the effects of the stage
               cuts, feed pressure, and sulfur compounds on the membrane
               separation performance under dry conditions were performed using
               both binary gas (70\% CH4, 30\% CO2) and simulated biogas (30\%
               CO2, 1900 ppm H2S, 100 ppm COS, and 100 ppm CS2, balance gas
               CH4). In addition, detailed theoretical investigations were
               conducted to understand the separation phenomena of the
               multicomponent gas through the hollow fiber membrane in
               conjunction with the experimental data for model validation; the
               model incorporated the mass transfer across the membrane and a
               concentration boundary layer adjacent to the membrane. The
               proposed model was in good agreement with the experimental
               results, which showed a relative error of < 5\%, compared to the
               model that did not consider the concentration polarization and
               that based on the conventional mass transfer correlation. The
               removal efficiency of the sulfur compounds was 70–80\% in the
               feed pressure range of 2.3–2.6 bar. Furthermore, the presence of
               sulfur compounds had a negligible effect on the separation
               performance of the polysulfone membrane. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",

               with water. During desalting it is essential to remove aqueous
               impurities from oil to avoid corrosion and fouling in upstream
               oil industry as well as catalyst deactivation in downstream
               processing. It is also important to simultaneously minimize the
               environmental impact of produced wastewater by cost-effective
               industrially feasible techniques. Since the ion content of
               wastewater discharge of oil desalter unit is far from saturation,
               its reuse for further desalting of crude oil is proposed in this
               study. Biocompatible carboxymethyl cellulose (Walocel), two
               methyl cellulose with different methyl and 2-hydroxypropyl
               derivative contents (Methocel K3 and Methocel E5), and cellulose
               acetate, are used to promote demulsification of well water- and
               lagoon wastewater-in-crude oil emulsion. Screening bottle tests
               revealed that Walocel and Methocel E5 are more suitable. Walocel
               and Methocel E5 at 3000 ppm could remove 97.6\% and 91.7\% of
               well water from oil at 80 °C. It was observed that presence of
               hydrocarbon impurities and previously added demulsifier in lagoon
               wastewater greatly enhances initial demulsification rate for
               Walocel and Methocel E5 up to 5.5 and 19.6 times, respectively.
               Walocel and Methocel E5 at a final concentration of 3000 ppm
               could remove 93.5 ± 3.6\% and 95.8 ± 4.2\% of lagoon wastewater
               within 60 min at 80 °C and finally remove all oil content of the
               emulsion. Superior performance of Methocel E5 in complete
               demulsification of lagoon wastewater-in-oil is attributed to
               abundance of hydrogen bond forming oxygen atoms in its cellulosic
               backbone as well as amphiphilic 2-hydroxypropyl and hydrophobic
               methyl side chains which constructively interact with water
               molecules and hydrocarbon impurities in the lagoon wastewater.
               The results of this study revealed that reuse of oily wastewater
               in crude oil desalting may be practical and such demulsification

               industrial production and emitted by fossil fuel combustion, in
               addition to being used as a drug of abuse. Its toxic effects in
               the central nervous system have not been well established, and
               how and which neurons are affected remains unknown. Hence, this
               study aimed to fill this gap by investigating three central
               questions: 1) How does toluene induce neurotoxicity? 2) Which
               neurons are affected? And 3) What are the long-term effects
               induced by airborne exposure to toluene? To this end, a
               Caenorhabditis elegans model was employed, in which worms at the
               fourth larval stage were exposed to toluene in the air for 24 h
               in a vapor chamber to simulate four exposure scenarios. After the
               concentration-response curve analysis, we chose scenarios 3 (E3:
               792 ppm) and 4 (E4: 1094 ppm) for the following experiments. The
               assays were performed 1, 48, or 96 h after removal from the
               exposure environments, and an irreversible reduction in neuron
               fluorescence and morphologic alterations were observed in
               different neurons of exposed worms, particularly in the
               dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, a significant impairment in a
               dopaminergic-dependent behavior was also associated with negative
               effects in healthspan endpoints, and we also noted that
               mitochondria may be involved in toluene-induced neurotoxicity
               since lower adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) levels and
               mitochondrial viability were observed. In addition, a reduction
               of electron transport chain activity was evidenced using ex vivo
               protocols, which were reinforced by in silico and in vitro
               analysis, demonstrating toluene action in the mitochondrial
               complexes. Based on these findings model, it is plausible that
               toluene neurotoxicity can be initiated by complex I inhibition,
               triggering a mitochondrial dysfunction that may lead to
               irreversible dopaminergic neuronal death, thus impairing
               neurobehavioral signaling. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",

               concentrations with the same additive package are tested, whose
               tribological properties and chemistry of the tribofilm are
               investigated. For the selected operating conditions in this
               study, the critical concentration of Mo is determined to be ≈ 350
               ppm due to its ability to reduce the friction to ≈ 0.04 under a
               constant and varying lambda ratio by forming the required

               complex at our institution between 2016 and 2019, we identified
               143 patients who developed new-onset LBBB during TAVI and divided
               them according to the resolution or persistence of LBBB by the
               next day post-TAVI to compare high-degree atrioventricular block
               (HAVB) and permanent pacemaker (PPM) rates. Patients with
               resolved LBBB (n = 74, 52\%), compared with those with persistent
               LBBB, were more often women and had a shorter QRS duration at
               baseline and post-TAVI, with a smaller S3 size and a shallower
               implantation depth. A multivariable logistic regression model
               demonstrated significant associations of post-TAVI QRS duration
               (per 10 ms increase, odds ratio = 0.60 [95\% confidence interval
               = 0.44 to 0.82]) and implantation depth (per 1-mm-depth-increase,
               0.77 [0.61 to 0.97]) with a lower likelihood of LBBB resolution.
               No patient with resolved LBBB developed HAVB within 30 days
               post-TAVI. Meanwhile, 8 patients (11.6\%) with persistent LBBB
               developed HAVB. The 2-year PPM rate was significantly higher
               after persistent LBBB than after resolved LBBB (30.3\% vs 4.5\%,
               log-rank p <0.001), mainly driven by higher 30-day PPM rate
               (18.8\% vs 0.0\%). In conclusion, about half of new-onset LBBBs
               that occurred during S3-TAVI resolved by the next day post-TAVI
               without HAVB. In contrast, new-onset persistent LBBB may need

               by various traditional methods including the widespread uses of
               synthetic chemicals. These applications have led to environmental
               degradation and loss of beneficial species. However, biological
               control, an ecofriendly control of mosquitoes through potential
               predators, is the key interest of today’s researchers. During the
               current research, predatory performance of three selected
               odonatan nymphs (Pantala flavescens, Trithemis aurora, Libellula
               fulva) was investigated against mosquitoes’ 3rd instar larvae.
               Furthermore, the effect of glyphosate herbicide on the predatory
               performance of these nymphs was also assessed. Results indicated
               higher larval consumption by P. flavescens, followed by T. aurora
               while less consumption by L. fulva during 24-h study. The
               difference among their predatory performance was not significant
               (p > 0.05). The predatory performance of P. flavescens was
               significantly reduced compared to the control by 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0
               ppm glyphosate, that of T. aurora by 2.5 and 5.0 ppm glyphosate

               performance of all the nymphs decreased with increasing

               species play a vital role in control of mosquito larvae. However,

               solution to produce chemicals and fuels has received considerable

               for chemical synthesis in a futuristic biorefinery. The
               fundamental challenge ahead of this is perceived to be catalyst
               deactivation from biogenic impurities that arrives from
               fermentation broth. Herein, model experiments on hydrogenation of
               a bio-renewable platform chemical, 6-amyl-α-pyrone (6PP), is
               designed by incorporating model impurities such as alanine (Ala),
               arginine (Arg), cysteine (Cys), methionine (Met), and bovine
               serum albumin (BSA). Interestingly, 100 ppm of sulfur-bearing
               impurities such as Cys and Met in the reaction significantly
               decreased reactant conversion. Ala does not affect the 6PP
               conversion, while Arg is observed to cause a moderate reduction
               in the conversion. A mechanistic route for catalyst inhibition
               from impurities is modeled using density functional theory (DFT)
               simulations. It is observed that the adsorption of Cys amino acid
               on the Pd (111) surface is followed by dissociation into atomic
               sulfur. In large proteins like BSA, several disulfide linkages
               are present. Interestingly, molecular dynamics (MD) studies
               reveal the spontaneous alignment of up to three disulfide
               linkages of BSA protein on the Pd (111) surface, elucidating that
               the disulfide linkages present in the protein play a crucial role

               BSA did not show any substantial changes in the catalyst
               activity, which may be due to the structural complexity of the
               protein that inhibits its diffusion into the active sites on the

               The highest desirability function was found as 72\% and achieved
               at 1168.82 rpm engine speed and lambda ratio of 0.971, inlet air

               scrap has increased. It is necessary to develop a new technology
               to efficiently remove oxygen impurities in titanium scrap.
               However, it is extremely difficult to remove oxygen directly from
               a solid solution of oxygen and titanium; thus, there is no
               effective deoxidation method for titanium at the industrial
               scale. In this study, the authors thermodynamically analyzed and
               considered the feasibility of a new technology to remove oxygen
               dissolved in titanium by utilizing the vapor of rare earth metals
               which have high vapor pressures at high temperatures, such as
               samarium, europium, thulium, and ytterbium. It was elucidated
               that titanium with oxygen levels of < 500 mass ppm could be
               obtained by exploiting the deoxidation ability of samarium,
               thulium, and ytterbium combined with their ability to form

               has led to significant investigation into rare earth element
               domestic resources. Much of this work focuses on unconventional
               potential ore stocks, including coal and coal byproducts. This
               investigation focuses on coal byproducts generated as ash from
               coal burning power stations. Wyoming's Powder River Basin hosts
               the largest U.S. coal stocks for energy production, providing
               approximately 40\% of all thermal coal mined in the U.S. In this
               effort, in section I, we have studied coal byproducts for rare
               earth element concentrations and compare these data to current
               alternative resource knowledge. We find that coal byproducts in
               this investigation are consistently high enough in rare earth
               element concentration (above the current Department of Energy 300
               ppm cutoff grade) to warrant consideration as a promising
               potential resource. Rare earth element behavior within the host
               coal seams is also considered in an effort to better understand
               resource prospecting and ore body description. In Section II, we
               evaluate the economic feasibility of rare earth extraction from
               Powder River Basin coal byproducts using net present value
               analysis and the rare earth concentrations data from Section I.
               We calculate the break-even ash-to-oxide output and input unit
               costs for four coal stations in the Powder River Basin. All four
               stations have break-even unit costs that are higher than the
               mine-to-oxide operating cost reported for a traditional rare
               earth element mine. This is a promising result, especially given
               that it is more costly to refine rare earths from mined material
               than from ash. The results are highly sensitive to rare earth
               prices: given low long-term prices, none of the four stations can
               feasibly break even. Section III summarizes federal policy
               considerations in rare earth element resource development. The
               history of policy development, most recent focus on rare earth
               element specific funding legislation, paired with section I and

               reactors, such as the Versatile Test Reactor currently under
               development. As such, understanding the relationship between
               microstructure and mechanical properties in the context of
               irradiation environments for these steels is critical. N content,
               and more specifically interstitial N, has been hypothesized to be
               detrimental to irradiated properties at lower temperatures (less
               than 0.3Tm) to a total of 6 dpa; however, in this work at a dose
               of 1 dpa the irradiated microstructure was improved with added N,
               leading to less irradiation hardening. Three variants of HT9 were
               irradiated with 1.5 MeV protons to a dose of 1 dpa at 300 ˚C. The
               HT9 variants included Low (10 ppm), Mid (190 ppm), and High (440
               ppm) N alloys that were otherwise nearly identical. Changing the
               N content had a variety of effects on the irradiated defect
               structures. As N content increased, the average dislocation loop
               diameter decreased, while the number density of loops increased.
               Additionally, extensive Ni clustering was observed on
               dislocations and interfaces. The Mid and High N specimens
               exhibited significantly less hardening (ΔHV≅100) relative to the
               Low N specimen (ΔHV≅160). The decrease in hardening is attributed

               is an option to improve quality characteristics of wine. However,
               quality of wine is greatly dependent on different initial
               variables which need to be optimized before preparation of any
               wine with desirable quality characteristics. Therefore, present
               study was conducted to investigate the effects of different
               initial variables, i.e., tea concentration (3–5 g tea per 100 ml
               of the apple juice), sugar concentration (18–22°B), DAHP
               concentration (0.1–0.3\%), KMS concentration (50–150 ppm) and
               inocula size (2.5–7.5\%) on quality attributes of apple tea wine.
               Results indicated that for all the variables under study exerted
               a significant effect on the alcoholicity and sensory quality
               characteristics of apple tea wine and the same has been observed
               during the cluster analysis of the data. The optimum wine
               qualities; rate of fermentation (0.78°B/24 h), ethanol (7.83\%),
               volatile acidity (0.025\%), fusel alcohol (84.62 mg/l) and
               overall acceptability (8.27) with 0.81 desirability were obtained
               using 4 g tea, 20°B initial sugar concentration, 0.2\% DAHP, 100

               biomarker concentrations and carbon isotopic composition of
               individual n-alkanes, these oils were derived from multiple
               source rocks within the Permian and Middle–Lower Jurassic strata
               within the early to late window of oil generation. Diamondoid
               concentrations and compositions of condensates were mainly
               controlled by the gas that subsequently charged the reservoirs
               and the extents of cap gas leakage. Two deeper condensates
               KS101C2 and KS101C3 at 6651–6835 m have extremely high
               concentrations of 4- + 3-methyldiamantanes (4 + 3MD) in the range
               of 2523–4296 ppm and very low ratios of adamantane/diamantane
               (A/D) and methyladamantanes/methyldiamantanes (MAs/MDs) in the
               ranges of 0.10–0.11 and 0.28–0.33, respectively, demonstrating
               that these reservoirs were charged by the primary gas with high
               diamondoid concentration that was generated from very deeply
               buried source rocks at post mature stage in combination with
               extensive leakage of the cap gas (the secondary gas). The
               shallower condensate K2C2 at 3319–3326 m has a moderate 4 + 3MD
               concentration of 18 ppm and very low ratios of A/D and MAs/MDs of
               0.00 and 0.19, respectively, demonstrating that this reservoir
               was charged by the secondary gas in combination with extensive
               leakage of the cap gas (the third-generation gas). The shallower
               condensate KX3C at 3765–3820 m has a lower 4 + 3MD concentration
               of 9 ppm but very high ratios of A/D and MAs/MDs of 8.60 and
               16.73, respectively, demonstrating that this reservoir was
               charged by the third-generation gas with or without minor cap gas
               leakage. The other twenty condensates have 4 + 3MD concentrations
               in the range of 7–23 ppm and ratios of A/D and MAs/MDs in the
               ranges of 0.60–5.29 and 2.18–12.18, respectively, demonstrating
               that these reservoirs were charged by the secondary or/and
               third-generation gases with different extents of cap gas leakage.
               Furthermore, cap gas leakage influenced alkyladamantane ratios of
               MAI, DMAI-1, TMAI-1, TMAI-2 and EAI but not the alkyldiamantane
               ratios of MDI, DMDI-1 and DMDI-2 for maturity and source. © 2022

               anti-inflammatory antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) were
               evaluated. Exposure of A549 cells to Cl2 (100–1000 ppm) in the
               cell medium induced cell damage and toxicity within 1 h in a
               dose-dependent manner. The results showed that 250 ppm Cl2
               increased cell death and formation of apoptotic-like bodies,
               while 500 ppm Cl2 exposure resulted in predominantly necrotic
               death. Pre-treatment with NAC was efficient to prevent cell
               damage at lower Cl2 concentrations in part by averting the

               death by a possibly caspase-independent mechanism, since no
               cleavage of caspase-3 could be detected after exposure to 250

               trace and rare earth elements. Low radionuclide concentration in
               rocks is due to weathering, metamorphism, and 12–86\% outward UM.
               The absorbed dose rate (ADR) average of 75.09 nGyh−1 was within
               the allowable range, with regression R-squared (R2) prediction

               due to their potential to wettability alteration, but not

               loss in brine environment, where nanoparticles tend to aggregate,
               is another issue for field implementation. Hence, recent
               challenge is to functionalize nanoparticles that are
               interfacially active and still stabilized in brine. The current
               study fabricated and characterized the
               polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated silica composite nanoparticles for
               their interfacial activity at the crude oil-water interface.
               Reduction in oil-water interfacial tension was observed and more
               dramatic with increasing particle concentration, confirming
               particle adsorption performance. In low-salinity brine (2000 ppm
               NaCl), the composite particles remained stabilized with weakened
               electrostatic force between particle and crude oil surfaces,
               while their size was smaller due to polymer shell dehydration.
               These led to faster diffusion rate than in Milli-Q water, which
               affected the rate of change in oil-water/brine interfacial
               tension, with the early-stage adsorption being a
               diffusion-controlled in both fluids. At equivalent particle
               concentration, the oil-water interfacial tensions in brine were
               lower than those of Milli-Q water (by ∼2 mN/m), with interfacial
               coverage of the particles at the interface was found to be higher
               in the brine. Such difference is attributed to a weaker repulsive
               force between particle and the interface, induced by surface
               charge screening that is only present in brine. The study has
               demonstrated the potential use of polymer-coated nanoparticles as
               suitable additives for use in oil recovery, which can be used
               concurrently with low-salinity brine as a combined fluid. While
               both chemicals are known to construct disjoining pressure for
               wettability alteration, advantage of using interfacially active
               nanoparticles is additional mechanism to enhance oil recovery,

               crust formed and evolved in the early Earth. Archean to
               Paleo-Proterozoic TTG rocks are widely reported in the North
               China Craton (NCC), and have been widely used to infer
               continental crust growth and reworking. Previous whole-rock
               geochemical studies on these rocks had led to the proposal of
               Neoarchean subduction onset and the establishment of the Meso- to
               Neoarchean thermal state for this craton. However, whole-rock
               geochemical compositions can be modified by post-magmatic
               alternation or metamorphism. The content of water in zircon (a
               resistant mineral) have the potential to characterize the hydrous
               state of magma. Here, in order to track the NCC geodynamic
               evolvement from the Mesoarchean to the Paleoproterozoic, we
               measured the H2O-in-zircon content with a newly developed low

               Neoarchean-Paleoproterozoic (2.8–2.1 Ga) TTG suite in the central

               ∼2.8 Ga TTG rocks to > 1000 ppm for ∼2.5 and ∼2.1 Ga TTG rocks.
               In addition, zircon elemental ratios (e.g., U/Yb and Nb/Yb) also
               show a markable magmatic provenance change at the same time from
               MOR (mid-ocean-ridge)-type to arc-type. We link these changes to

               number of delay cells (that sense the fraction phase) have been
               reduced to zero. As no pre-calibration of the delay values are
               required, it becomes immune to process-voltage-temperature
               variation. Simulation results for frequency convergence have been
               provided for different target frequencies of an LC oscillator and
               for an accuracy of 400 ppm. The paper next presents the design
               and analysis of a voltage controlled oscillator in the form of an
               astable multivibrator that is similar to a single stage ring
               oscillator. A novel resistive tuning technique that occupies
               small chip area and provides less process variation and more
               matching has been proposed. Also, it has been shown that although
               the oscillator’s phase noise is worse than LC oscillator, the
               frequency convergence probability (when using the frequency
               calibration unit with 4 delay cells, due to the high jitter
               values) does not degrade significantly with the same calibration
               unit specifications. Hence successful integration of the
               oscillator with the calibration unit is possible with the
               advantage of having fully on-chip design with lower power
               consumption than that of LC oscillators. The oscillator and the
               calibration circuit have been designed in UMC 180 nm technology

               Current limits of detections (LoDs) of LIMS instruments are in
               the ppm to sub-ppm range (atomic fractions), while other commonly
               used techniques for solid sample analysis reach LoDs at ppb
               levels or even below. This study presents the implementation of
               mass-selective beam blanking in the Laser Mass Spectrometer –
               Gran Turismo (LMS-GT) to improve the instruments’ detection
               limit. LMS-GT is a high-performance time-of-flight LIMS
               instrument coupled to a femtosecond laser ablation ion source
               reaching micrometre spatial resolutions and mass resolutions ≳
               12′000. A fast high voltage switch was developed in-house to
               induce potential changes at an Einzel lens at the intermediate
               time focus of the ion trajectory, leading to short deflections of
               the ion beam and hindering selected species from reaching the
               detector. The intensities of single mass lines are reduced with
               100\% efficiency to below the noise floor when blanked. The
               detector gain can safely be increased while blanking the most
               intense mass lines simultaneously, thus improving the detection
               limit. The LoD of LMS-GT prior to the installation of the
               mass-selective blanking device was at ppm level (at. frac.) with
               few sub-ppm detections, the installation pushed it to the lower

               studies were carried out for the removal of Pb from water.
               Graphene oxide (GO) was used as adsorbent, which was synthesized
               by modified hummers method using graphite from waste dry cell
               battery. The prepared GO was characterized by FESEM, TEM, XRD,

               highly porous GO was successfully prepared from graphite rod of
               waste dry cell battery. Batch experiments were performed to
               investigate the effects of pH, contact time, adsorbent dose on
               the adsorption process, and optimum condition for adsorption was
               determined. Experiments showed 98.87\% removal of Pb (10 ppm) in
               a very short time (20 min) at pH 4 while adsorbent dose was 0.25
               gL−1. The oxygenated groups on the surface of GO played a crucial
               role in the adsorption of Pb on GO. Experimental data were tested
               against kinetic and adsorption isotherm models. The adsorption
               process followed pseudo-second-order kinetics, Langmuir isotherm
               at lower temperature (20 and 30 °C), and Freundlich isotherm at
               higher temperature (40 °C). The maximum adsorption capacity was

               was exothermic and spontaneous under 20–40 °C, which indicates
               that adsorption was feasible. Therefore, this study represents a

               Degradation mechanisms involve the accumulation of these brittle

               methodology. In addition, this is an original study that provides
               an analysis of existing technologies as Value Stream Mapping
               (VSM) and Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) within the 8D
               concept in terms of offering a new model and proposing an
               effective methodology. The purpose of this study is to minimize
               quality failures and increase the efficiency of the method within
               the framework of lean production by using the 8D methodology,
               which includes quality techniques such as Failure Mode Effect
               Analysis (FMEA) in the automotive industry. As a result of this
               study, it was determined that by applying the 8D methodology, the
               total parts per million (ppm) was reduced to about 0.00 from
               1,071 and this improvement resulted in savings. It can be claimed
               that 8D can be used as a quality management method in process

               and TEs in black shales from Duwi Formation of two mines, Um
               Al-Huwaitat and Hamadat, located in the Safaga-Qussier region.
               The chemical results indicated oxic marine along with warm and
               humid climate conditions of this sediment deposition. Um
               Al-Huwaitat Mine was highly enriched with total REEs (average
               255.3–325.3 ppm) than Hamadat (average 157–207.4 ppm). Thus, it
               revealed that the total REEs decreased from Safaga to Qussier
               direction. The average content of REEs has nearly the same
               decreasing order of elements; they are arranged in decreasing
               order: Ce> Y> La> Nd> Sc> Sm and Ce> Y> La> Nd> Sc> Sm for
               Hamadat and Um El-Huwaitat Mines, respectively. The REEs and TEs
               concentrations are normalized to the UCC to investigate their
               distribution patterns. REEs and TEs concentration in the studied
               samples were higher than UCC, especially Y, Sc, Cs, Co, Zn, Zr,
               Mo, Cd, Hf, Ta, W, Bi, Se, Br, I, Th and U. The enrichment factor
               showed that Um Al-Huwaitat black shale is extremely enriched with
               Y, Cs, Sr, Mo, Cd, W, Bi, Se, I and U; and very high enriched
               with Ce, Nd, Sc, Co, and Br. La, Sm, Cr, Mn, Ni, Zn, and Th
               revealed significant enrichment. Clay minerals, especially
               montmorillonite, have been the major contributor to the
               enrichment of shale with REEs and TEs. Such findings point
               towards shale mineralisation with these elements. The current

               (1D) TiO2 nanorods were grown over a conductive titanium (Ti)
               substrate by optimizing various physical and chemical parameters
               involved in the hydrothermal method. Previous works have reported
               extensively on the synthesis of 1D TiO2 nanorods on
               fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glass substrates using the
               hydrothermal method. However, glass substrates suffer from poor
               integration, compatibility, and stability issues when implemented
               in device applications. To overcome the challenges with glass
               substrates, in the current study, we propose an optimized
               hydrothermal route to synthesize highly ordered 1D TiO2 nanorods
               on a metal (Ti) substrate. The structural and morphological
               parameters of the nanostructures, including crystal phase,
               length, diameter, and density of nanorods, were studied with the
               help of field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission
               electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction spectroscopy, and
               photoluminescence spectroscopy. The morphology of the
               nanostructures was varied by changing the chemical composition of
               the mother solution and physical parameters of time and
               temperature of the reactions involved during hydrothermal
               synthesis. It was shown that by optimizing the reaction
               parameters, multi-crystalline three-dimensional TiO2 nanoflowers
               could be transformed to single-crystalline 1D TiO2 nanorods.

               implemented in a metal–insulator–metal (MIM) type of device
               (Au/TiO2 nanorods/Ti) and used for ethanol sensing. At 100°C, the

               N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solution would provide more
               understanding of membrane formation. Methods: CA+CQDs membrane
               was fabricated through non-solvent induced phase separation,
               using water as coagulant. Kinetic and thermodynamics behavior of
               polymer solution affected the phase separation mechanism. The
               thermodynamic behavior was observed in cloud-point curve from the
               ternary phase diagram of CA/NMP/water, whereas the kinetic was
               studied by correlating the viscosity of the dope with light

               developed and examined at three different operating parameters at
               three levels, namely, feed temperature (45 °C, 55 °C, 65 °C),
               feed concentration (75 ppm, 100 ppm, 125 ppm) and flowrate (0.6

               conditions (feed temperature: 65 °C, feed concentration: 75 ppm,
               flowrate: 0.8 LPM) are found, and optimum permeate flux is

               rejection. The effect of operating parameters (feed temperature,
               feed concentration, \& flow rate) on permeate flux has also been
               investigated. Different membrane characterization analysis
               methods like SEM, FTIR, and XRD are performed to identify the
               fouling resistance of both membranes. A long run test has also
               been examined to determine the performance of the M2 membrane. M2
               membrane showed high stability in long run test, making it
               suitable for industrial-scale applications. Lastly, the
               self-cleaning ability of the membrane is also experimentally

               treatment temperature, with higher temperatures leading to higher
               levels of crystallinity and larger grain size. For the
               experimental conditions considered in this work, films with one

               technical application. In this work, the MBGS process for the
               disposal of wastewater with simple and complex organic substances
               was evaluated in a comparable manner. The results showed that the

               75.2/84.9\%, 96.6/89.3\% and 76.2/85.3\%, respectively. It has
               been found that complex organics can promote granule size growth
               and bacteria growth, as evidenced by the decrease in chlorophyll
               content and cellular carbon-nitrogen ratio compared to simple
               organics. Chloroflexi became the dominant bacterium of MBGS for
               potential contribution to the breakdown of complex organic
               matter. In addition, the settling property of MBGS has been
               improved and the extracellular protein of MBGS has been

               However, the dependence of the magnetostricitive properties on
               the size and volume fraction of the modified-D03 phase remains
               unclear. Here, the morphology evolution and density change of
               modified-D03 nanoinclusions in (Fe81Ga19)99.9Tb0.1 single crystal
               were characterized by transmission electron microscopy upon
               in-situ heating process (298 K to 773 K), and their correlative
               influence on magnetostriction behavior was revealed. The
               morphology and density of modified-D03 nanoinclusions vary
               slightly when heating temperature is lower than 473 K, leading to
               the almost unchanged magnetostriction in (Fe81Ga19)99.9Tb0.1
               alloys. When heating from 473 K to 773 K, modified-D03
               nanoinclusions evolve into a band-like distribution rather than
               being randomly distributed in A2 matrix at lower temperature, and
               the magnetostrictive properties decrease with the increased size
               of modified-D03 nanoinclusions from ~5 nm to ~25 nm during the
               heating process. The decreased density of modified-D03
               nanoinclusions caused by phase transition from modified-D03 to A2
               results in further reduction of magnetostrictive properties when
               heating at 773 K. The magnetostriction of (Fe81Ga19)99.9Tb0.1
               single crystal can recover to 325 ppm by quenching from 973 K,
               which results from the re-precipitation of modified-D03
               nanoinclusions with small size. The results provide a basis for
               optimizing the magnetostrictive performance of Fe81Ga19(Tb)
               alloys. The enhanced magnetostriction of Fe81Ga19(Tb) alloys

               the increase of magnesium content in the molten steel, inclusions
               of Al2O3-CaO were first modified to Al2O3-MgO and
               MgO-CaS(-MgS)-MnS, then transformed to MgO-CaS-MgS-MnS and
               Al2O3-MgO, and finally MgS-MgO-CaS-MnS in the water-quenched
               samples. Thermodynamic calculation results revealed that the
               evolution path of inclusions in the molten steel with magnesium
               was Al2O3-CaO → Al2O3-MgO-CaS → CaS-MgO-MgS → MgS-CaS-MnS-MgO,

               SEM–EDS analysis and the non-aqueous solution electrolytic method
               showed that the roundness and size of inclusions in the solid
               steel decreased first with 13 ppm magnesium, higher content of
               magnesium promoted the formation of complex MnS-MgS-MgO-CaS

               value-added solid carbonates is the key to reduce the overall
               costs. In this paper, we propose a novel concept not only for CO2
               fixation but also recovery of rare earth elements (REEs) via the
               pH swing-assisted carbonation process. The blast furnace slag was

               the precipitation agent. The results revealed that the maximum
               REEs can be obtained in NaOH and oxalic acid-assisted pH swing
               carbonation and were 1986.1 and 9349.2 ppm, respectively. The CO2
               storage capacities for NaOH and oxalic acid-assisted pH swing
               carbonation were also calculated to 107.38 and 117.89 kg

               simultaneous CO2 storage and REE recovery. These findings confirm

               usually labor-intensive and professional work. In this work, we
               propose a novel shape and boundary-aware deep learning model for
               medical image segmentation based on semi-supervised learning. The
               model makes good use of labeled data and also enables unlabeled
               data to be well applied by using task consistency loss. Firstly,
               we adopt V-Net for Pixel-wise Segmentation Map (PSM) prediction
               and Signed Distance Map (SDM) regression. In addition, we
               multiply multi-scale features, extracted by Pyramid Pooling
               Module (PPM) from input X, with 2 − |SDM| to enhance the features
               around the boundary of the segmented target, and then feed them
               into the Feature Fusion Module (FFM) for fine segmentation.
               Besides boundary loss, the high-level semantics implied in SDM
               facilitate the accurate segmentation of boundary regions.
               Finally, we get the ultimate result by fusing coarse and
               boundary-enhanced features. Last but not least, to mine unlabeled
               training data, we impose consistency constraints on the three
               core outputs of the model, namely PSM1, SDM, and PSM3. Through
               extensive experiments over three representative but challenging
               medical image datasets (LA2018, BraTS2019, and ISIC2018) and
               comparisons with the existing representative methods, we validate
               the practicability and superiority of our model. © 2022 Elsevier

               (i.e. through the chloroplast-localized oxidative branch of the
               pentose phosphate pathway) into the Calvin–Benson cycle was
               proposed recently. Here, we measured intramolecular deuterium

               ambient CO2 concentrations, Ca. Additionally, we modelled
               deuterium fractionations expected for the anaplerotic pathway and
               compared modelled with measured fractionations. We report
               deuterium fractionation signals at H1 and H2 of starch glucose.
               Below a Ca change point, these signals increase with decreasing
               Ca consistent with modelled fractionations by anaplerotic flux.
               Under standard conditions (Ca = 450 ppm corresponding to

               hallmarked by high permeability pulmonary edema and hypoxemic
               respiratory failure and is associated with high mortality.
               Current treatment protocols rely on improving O2 delivery,
               decreasing O2 consumption, and treating the underlying cause of
               the initial insult. In this study, we used a small rodent model
               of ARDS, where we induced lung injury with inhalation of
               lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We investigated three different
               treatments, namely inhaled NO at 70 ppm, inhaled NO at 140 ppm,
               and NO-np (10 mg/mL), compared with untreated rodents 72 h after
               initial insult. Concurrent with treatment, the fraction of
               inspired O2 was increased after 30 min from 21\% to 40\% and
               finally to 60\%. At an FiO2 of 60\% and 72 h post induction of
               ARDS, NO-np treated mice had an arterial PO2 (PaO2) of 142 ± 9
               mmHg, higher than mice treated with inhaled NO at 70 ppm (87 ± 5
               mmHg, p = 8.4 × 10-8) and inhaled NO at 140 ppm (107 ± 6 mmHg, p

               improved arterial PO2 at a high FiO2 compared to inhaled NO alone
               and NO-np reduced both circulating and pulmonary interstitial

               receptor blocker valsartan. Among these impurities, PGI-1 is a
               distinctive compound which has never been reported. For this,
               chromatographic separation was performed using a Waters XBridge
               BEH C18 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 2.5 µm), with ammonium acetate
               aqueous solution (0.01 mol/L) as mobile phase A and acetonitrile
               as mobile phase B, in a gradient elution mode at a 0.5 mL/min
               flow rate. Mass spectrometric conditions were optimized using
               electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive mode. Following the
               International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, this
               methodology is capable of quantifying 2 PGIs at 0.016 ppm in

               presented good linearity over the concentration range of
               0.016–0.06 ppm for 2 PGIs. The correlation coefficient of each
               impurity was observed greater than 0.999. The accuracy of this
               method was in the range of 83–113\% for the aforementioned PGIs.
               In addition, expert knowledge rules (Derek-based) and statistical
               (Q) SAR evaluation system (Sarah-based) were used to evaluate and
               classify the genotoxicity of both valsartan-related PGIs as well
               as to define their standard limits. The predicted results were
               positive and classified into the third category, and the total

               discovered in the Tongshanling Cu–polymetallic ore field, South
               China. This contribution reports new results from
               cathodoluminescence, trace element, and Nd–O isotopic analyses of
               scheelite samples from Tongshanling, designed to better constrain
               the W mineralization process and origin of associated metals and
               metallogenic fluids. Three generations of scheelite were
               identified that can be attributed to three paragenetic phases:
               (i) an early prograde skarn stage dominated by massive garnet and
               diopside intergrown with fine-grained scheelite, (ii) an
               intermediate retrograde skarn stage characterized by an
               assemblage of abundant scheelite, medium-grained chlorite and
               epidote, and (iii) a late sulfide-quartz vein stage typified by
               coarse-grained, subhedral scheelite grains that are typically
               intergrown with chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and galena. Our data
               show that although WO3 and CaO concentrations are similar in
               scheelite of all three stages and rare earth element (REE)
               patterns vary, the ∑REE + Y values of scheelite markedly and
               progressively decrease from the prograde skarn (mean = 901 ppm)
               to retrograde skarn (70.1 ppm) to the sulfide-quartz vein (34.1
               ppm) stages. This signature is consistent with either of the
               following scenarios: The coprecipitation of REE-enriched minerals
               (e.g., garnet and scheelite), a change in fluid oxygen fugacity
               change and/or minor distortions in crystal texture. The δ18OH2O
               values of fluids linked to the prograde skarn and sulfide-quartz
               vein stages (5.02‰–6.19‰) are consistent with a magmatic fluid
               input. The δ18OH2O values of fluids associated with the
               retrograde skarn stage (2.85‰–3.45‰), on the other hand, are
               indicative of fluid mixing, possibly reflecting dilution of
               magmatic fluids by meteoric waters. Interestingly, scheelite
               samples of the sulfide-quartz vein stage returned low εNd(t)
               values (−7.46 to − 7.07) and moderate two-stage Nd model ages

               deposit (Yenisei Ridge, Russia) are presented. The deposit was
               formed in three stages, separated by tectonic breaks. Early (I)
               corresponds to the paragenesis of acicular arsenopyrite + pyrite
               + pyrrhotite. At the stage of base-metal sulfides (II), the
               deposition of the bulk of chalcopyrite, sphalerite and galena
               occurred. Mineral associations of these stages determined the
               gold-arsenic (Au-As) type of ores. The stage of late sulfides
               (III) is characterized by the paragenesis of antimony minerals
               (stibnite + berthierite + gudmundite) and corresponds to the

               progress of the ore deposition process with the formation of late
               polymetallic and stibnite-berthierite mineralization led to
               recrystallization of early sulfides (prismatic arsenopyrite Au ∼
               36.4 ppm → dipyramidal arsenopyrite Au ∼ 0.5 ppm), remobilization
               and re-deposition of gold in a native form. Pyrite of the deposit

               porphyry deposit of Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines is a high-grade
               Cu-Au orebody dominantly composed of quartz fragments. The QBX
               can be subdivided into different facies, each characterized by a
               particular spatial distribution and mineral composition. This
               study utilized petrographic, electron-probe, scanning electron
               microscope, and fluid inclusion analyses on the samples from
               different QBX facies to provide new insights about mineralization
               styles, gold occurrence, and ore-forming conditions. Based on
               their respective mineral assemblages, two styles of
               mineralization were determined for the QBX: (1) porphyry and (2)
               epithermal. The porphyry-style mineralization is characterized by
               early-stage disseminated and vein-hosted sulfides and alteration
               consisting of chalcopyrite, bornite, chlorite, biotite,
               magnetite, quartz, K-feldspar, and actinolite. The assemblage
               formed from high temperature (420–440 °C), high salinity brines
               (22–49 wt\% NaCl) possibly derived from a magmatic source. The
               porphyry-style mineralization occurs mainly as disseminations in
               quartz-sulfide veins within diorite wall rocks, Quan porphyry,
               and Bufu syenite. These altered intrusive bodies were eventually
               fragmented to form a low-grade (<5 ppm Au) distal facies
               (QBX-Monz, QBX-Dio) and a lower contact facies (QBX-Sy), above
               and below the breccia core, respectively. Gold occurs as
               Au-Ag-Cu-Te blebs (gold telluride) at phase boundaries in
               bornite-chalcopyrite symplectites. The epithermal-style
               mineralization is embodied by a late-stage gold mineralization
               event that precipitated chalcopyrite, pyrite, sphalerite, galena,
               tennantite, calcite, and Te- and Se-minerals. The later
               epithermal fluids were of relatively low temperature (300–320 °C)
               and low salinity (3–4 wt\% NaCl), indicative of diluted
               hydrothermal fluids. The vein-hosted epithermal mineral
               assemblage is observed in clasts of the upper contact facies
               (QBX-FP) and in the matrix and cement of the moderate- to
               high-grade (∼10–83 ppm Au) central facies (QBX-Un, QBX-Act). In
               this paragenetic stage, gold occurs as native gold hosted in
               chalcopyrite, pyrite, and tellurides – within fractures or as
               inclusions – and as invisible gold in pyrite. The close
               relationship between the gold and chalcogenides supports the
               Ag-Bi-Te scavenger model, which suggests that the presence of Ag,
               Bi, Se, and Te in magmatic hydrothermal ore-forming fluids aids
               in concentrating Au at high temperatures and exsolving it at

               also used to assist in decontaminating spaces with odors or
               chemical/biological hazards. The amount of ozone released in a
               small area may exceed public health standards, compromising
               indoor air quality. Long-term exposure to ozone can potentially
               cause harmful health effects such as respiratory illness and
               decreased lung function, as well as damage to materials and
               vegetation. Therefore, ozone monitoring and control policies are
               essential for preserving outdoor and indoor air quality. The
               determination of ozone gas is still a challenge for modern
               analytical chemistry, due to its wide concentration range (low
               ppb to low ppm), short-term fluctuations, and high reactivity,
               together with the difficulty in preparing reliable standard
               solutions. Advances in various ozone measurement techniques have
               been published over the last ten years. The methods for
               monitoring ozone aim to combine qualities such as real-time
               measurement, low cost, portability, miniaturization, detection of
               a wide concentration range, and analytical reliability. However,
               techniques with high applicability need to be further explored in

               value. To systematically ascertain the metallogenesis of these
               nodules, we investigate their microstructure, mineralogy, and
               elemental concentrations, as well as their Nd and Hf isotopic
               compositions. The seabed nodules in the study area are formed in
               a low-temperature marine environment, with low crystallinity and
               detrital components. The minerals identified by XRD contain a
               large amount of vernadite (mean 63.6\%) and a small amount of
               todorokite (mean 7.2\%), indicating an oxidized metallogenic
               environment. Moreover, the high contents of Co (0.31–0.51 wt\%,
               mean 0.46\%), Ti (mean 1.28\%), rare earth elements and yttrium
               (REY, mean 1969 ppm), as well as the high δCe, and Fe/Mn ratios,
               differ from those of diagenetic and mixed-type nodules,
               confirming the typical hydrogenetic chemical composition of the
               nodules. Extended exposure to oxidizing deep-water environments,
               as a consequence of oligotrophic, continuous bottom current
               activities together with constant low sedimentation rates,
               provides optimal conditions for the Co-rich ferromanganese
               nodules (Co-rich nodules) to enrich multiple elements from
               seawater. Notably, Mn, Co, Ce and Pb are scavenged elements with
               low contents that decrease with water depth, and are primarily
               regulated by Mn–Fe oxyhydroxide in the water column.
               Nutrient-type elements, such as Fe, Ti, Cu, Ni, and REY (except
               Ce) can also be highly enriched in Co-rich nodules; however, they
               are mainly controlled by biological particles in water column.
               Collectively, coulombic interactions represent the major driving
               force for selective enrichment of metallic elements for Co-rich
               nodules from seawater. εNd and εHf also show that the Co-rich
               nodules are hydrogenetic ranging from −6.33 to −4.41 and from
               +5.00 to +6.18, respectively. The εNd of the Co-rich nodules was
               significantly lower than that of the Co-rich ferromanganese
               crusts observed on seamounts, indicating that the nodules are
               more affected by bottom currents. The nodules and crusts in the
               northwestern Pacific have rich radioactive Nd isotopic
               compositions, which is consistent with the high εNd observed
               along the Pacific margins, caused by the weathering of
               terrigenous components. © 2022",

  abstract  = "U.S. chestnut (Castanea sp.) production is expanding as knowledge
               of seedling cultivation and germplasm advances. Chestnuts have
               high starch and water content, making them highly perishable;
               therefore, they require cold storage immediately following
               harvest. Postharvest spoilage remains a significant area for
               improvement. Several postharvest fungi (including Fusarium sp.
               and Penicillium sp.) can infect chestnuts during storage, leading
               to spoilage and nonsellable nuts. The annual crop losses can
               reach up to 10\%, thereby affecting trees differently. Our
               research objectives were to 1) evaluate spoilage incidence on the
               interior (i.e., pellicle, kernel) and exterior (i.e., nutshell)
               of the nut over the course of 200 days of cold storage on eight
               cultivars and 2) assess the impact of food contact-approved
               chlorine solution and 2\% peracetic acid (PAA) with 27\% hydrogen
               peroxide prestorage treatments for spoilage suppression on ‘Qing’
               nuts. Fourteen timepoints were observed during the study period,
               each with four replications of 16 nuts. An additional four
               replicates of 16 ‘Qing’ nuts were treated prestorage and observed
               over seven time points. The incidence of spoilage was reported as
               the percentage of nonsellable nuts for each treatment and
               cultivar at four timepoints. The nut interior showed the highest
               spoilage incidence after 200 days, with four cultivars having
               >30\% nonsellable nuts. Overall, the cultivars had an average of
               10\% nonsellable nuts from interior spoilage after 60 days in
               storage. ‘Hong Kong’ had the highest percentage of nonsellable
               nuts by the end of the study at 60\%, whereas ‘Qing’ and
               ‘Mossbarger’ had the lowest rates, with only 14\% nonsellable
               nuts. Spoilage of the exterior, although less frequent, is
               visible to buyers and impacts nut marketability. ‘Kohr’ had the
               highest percentage of nonsellable nuts because of exterior
               spoilage (35.9\%). ‘Mossbarger’ had the lowest percentage of
               nonsellable nuts because of exterior spoilage (3.1\%). ‘Qing’
               nuts treated with 500 ppm chlorine and 100/200 ppm PAA
               demonstrated reduced exterior spoilage with longer storage times.
               Prestorage treatment did not show efficacy for reducing interior
               spoilage. This study provides a preliminary report of evidence
               that cultivar differences influence the spoilage incidence and
               supports taking nuts to market within 60 days of harvesting.

               isotope study of carbonatites and associated silicate rocks from
               the Tajno Massif (NE Poland). The Tajno Intrusion is a
               Tournaisian-Visean ultramafic-alkaline-carbonatite body emplaced
               within the Paleoproterozoic rocks of the East European Craton
               (EEC). Carbonatites of the Tajno Massif can be subdivided into
               the calciocarbonatite (calcite), ferrocarbonatite (ankerite), and
               breccias with an ankerite-fluorite matrix. Due to location at the
               cratonic margin and abundance in the REE, Tajno classifies (Hou
               et al., 2015) as the carbonatite-associated REE deposit (CARD),
               and more precisely as the Dalucao-Style orebody (the
               breccia-hosted orebody). High Fe2O3 (13.8 wt\%), MnO (2.1 wt\%),
               total REE (6582 ppm), Sr (43895 ppm), Ba (6426 ppm), F (greater
               than10000 ppm) and CO2 contents points for the involvement of the
               slab – including pelagic metalliferous sediments – in the
               carbonatites formation. Spatial relations and Sr isotope
               composition ((87Sr/86Sr)i = 0.7043–0.7048; Wiszniewska et al.,
               2020) of alkali clinopyroxenite and syenite suggest that these
               are products of differentiation of the magma, generated by the
               initial melting of the SCLM due to influx of F-rich fluids from
               subducted marine sediments. Carbonatites Sr isotope composition
               ((87Sr/86Sr)i = 0.7037–0.7038), and Ba/Th (16–20620) and Nb/Y
               (0.01–6.25) ratios, link their origin with a more advanced
               melting of the SCLM, triggered by CO2-rich fluids from the
               subducted AOC and melts from sediments. The Tajno Massif – and
               coeval mafic-alkaline intrusions – age, high potassic
               composition, and location along the craton margin nearly parallel
               the Variscan deformation front, are suggesting Variscan
               subduction beneath the EEC. The oxygen isotope compositions of
               clinopyroxene (δ18O value = 5.2‰) and alkali feldspar (δ18O value
               = 5.7‰), from alkali clinopyroxenite and foid syenite,
               respectively, are consistent with mantle-derived magmas. Isotopic
               compositions of carbonatites and breccias (carbonate δ18O = 8.7‰
               to 10.7‰; δ13C = -4.8‰ to −0.4‰) span from values of primary
               carbonatites to carbonatites affected by a fractionation or
               sedimentary contamination. The highest values (δ18O = 10.7‰; δ13C
               = -0.4‰) were reported for breccia cut by numerous veins
               confirming post-magmatic hydrothermal alteration. The lowest
               carbonate δ18O (9.3‰ to 10.7‰) and δ13C (−5.0‰ to −3.8‰) values
               are reported for veins in alkali clinopyroxenites, whereas the
               highest δ18O (11.2‰) and δ13C (−1.2‰ to −1.1‰) values are for
               veins in syenites and trachytes. Isotopic composition of veins
               suggests hydrothermal origin, and interaction with host
               mantle-derived rocks, as well as country rocks. In silicate rocks
               of the Tajno Massif, fluid influx leads to the development of Pb,
               Zn, Cu, Ag, Au sulfide mineralization-bearing stockwork vein
               system, with carbonate, silicate and fluorite infilling the
               veins. Bulk-rock contents of molybdenum (925 ppm), rhenium (905
               ppb) and palladium (29 ppb) are notable. The Re-rich molybdenite
               association with galena, pyrite and Th-rich bastnäsite in
               carbonate veins is similar as in Mo deposits associated with

               novel CO2 pre-combustion capture technology with the advantage of
               relatively low energy cost. Herein, the mixed matrix membranes
               (MMMs) were synthesized through a facile in-situ method for
               enhanced desorption of CO2 from dimethyl carbonate (DMC). ZIF-8
               nanoparticles were synthesized in situ on polydimethylsiloxane
               (PDMS). The morphology, microstructure and thermal stabilities
               were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray
               diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and thermal
               gravimetric analyzer (TGA). Results revealed that fabrication of
               ZIF-8 nanoparticles on PDMS matrix greatly increased CO2 flux of
               the membrane without any leakage of DMC. The membrane showed
               superior performance with increase of temperature and feed
               pressure. In particular, PPM-4 exhibited the highest CO2 flux of
               2670 g/ m2·h at 0.4 MPa (20 °C) with the feed flow rate of 0.8
               L/min. It was found that the use of DMC absorption-PDMS membrane
               desorption technology significantly reduces the cost of CO2
               capture. The enhanced performance of this combination of a new
               absorbent and mixed matrix membranes will open new routes for

               Tl of 0.95–109 ppm, Sb of 31.16–1851 ppm, Cu of 49.09–910 ppm,
               with average Co/Ni ratios of 0.43. Au was positively correlated
               with As, Tl, Cu, and Ni in these pyrites. Electron micro probe
               analyzer (EMPA) elemental mappings show that: 1) Py1 has a low Au
               content, while Py2, Py3, and Py4 have high Au, As, Cu, Ti, and Mg
               contents; 2) Au occurs in As-rich pyrite in the form of invisible
               gold; 3) Rim pyrite contains high concentrations of Cu, which has
               a good positive correlation with As, while As and Au are
               decoupled on a smaller scale. The Au contents and Au/As ratios
               show that the Au-carrying fluids are unsaturated with Au. In situ
               S isotopes show that the δ34S values range from 10.19‰ to 13.79‰
               with a mean value of 12.07‰ for Py1, 8.60‰ to 10.78‰ with a mean
               value of 9.77‰ for Py2, 1.42‰ to 8.29‰ with a mean value of 6.81‰
               for Py3, and − 0.49‰ to 4.42‰ with a mean value of 1.67‰ for Py4.
               The δ34S data decreased from Py1 to Py4, whereas the As content
               increased significantly. This indicates that Au and As are
               enriched in ore-forming fluids, and the ore-forming fluids have
               low S isotope values. Based on a comprehensive study of
               geological and geochemical data, we believe that the magmatic
               hydrothermal genetic model can explain the genesis of the Gaolong
               gold deposit. We conclude that the S isotope of pyrites resulted
               from the mixing of magmatic S and sedimentary S, and the
               Au-bearing fluid came from deep-concealed granite, establishing a
               magma genesis of the Gaolong Au deposit. © 2022 The Author(s)",

  abstract  = "The Serra Dourada Granite (SDG) is a roughly ellipsoidal massif
               with batholith dimensions that crop out in Goiás and Tocantins
               States, Central Brazil. It has been studied since the 1970′s due
               to its position in a complex geological framework, and exploited
               by both artisanal miners and mining companies, targeting mainly
               cassiterite. Circa 2008–2011, it begun to be systematically
               surveyed in respect to its REE occurrences, culminating in the
               Serra Verde Deposit, a REE ion adsorption-type mineralization
               hosted in a reddish coarse-grained biotite granite, the first of
               its kind in Brazil. Given that the massif has multiple facies,
               this paper reports the REE residence and behaviour along a
               weathering profile beyond the current limits of the Serra Verde
               Deposit, formed at the expense of a pinkish fine-grained
               muscovite-biotite granite, in order to verify its potential to
               host a similar mineralization. It also presents the results of a
               2-step sequential leaching, to assess the REE recovery from the
               weathered material. Monazite-(Ce), xenotime-(Y), zircon, thorite,
               REE fluorocarbonates and fluorite were the main REE sinks
               identified at the base of the profile, where the parental granite
               occurs. In weathered samples from horizons above, monazite-(Ce),
               Th-rich monazite, xenotime-(Y), thorite, Ti-bearing Fe-oxide,
               cassiterite, Pb-rich cassiterite, Pb-oxide and zircon were the
               main accessory minerals. Whole-rock analyses in the parental
               granite reveals REE contents of 828 ppm, and the highest grade
               saprolite samples yields 1,075 ppm. The chondrite-normalized REE
               patterns of all samples shows that the granite is LREE-selective,
               as well as the patterns obtained after the complete extraction.
               Positive Ce anomalies characterize the upper samples, whereas
               negative Ce anomaly characterizes horizons below. The recovery
               rate of the weakly adsorbed REE ions (step-1) ranges from 16 to
               31\%, whereas step-2 (REE associated with Fe-oxides), extracts
               44–57\% relative to whole rock REE. XRD analyses reveals that
               kaolinite and illite are the most abundant clays in weathered
               samples, so that those clays are the main reservoirs that adsorb
               REE ions released from minerals during weathering. The
               accumulation of the LREE in the uppermost and lower half of the
               profile coupled with HREE depletion, arises from the different
               resistance to weathering of LREE- and HREE-enriched minerals in
               the bedrock and saprolite. The HREE higher affinity with
               complexants such as OH–, F and CO32– possibly present in
               percolating water may also play a secondary role in leaching them
               out contributing the the HREE depletion. The main conclusions of
               this study is that easily soluble LREE fluorocarbonates provide
               most of the REE to the weathering profile, and that the overall
               REE grade in saprock and saprolite is akin to other important
               ion-adsorption ores, although the REE contents in leachate
               solutions herein are somewhat lower than others. The exception is
               Ce, which contents and recovery, specially following step-2, are
               considerable. © 2022 The Authors",

               dependent on concentration and temperature, with the maximum
               efficiency (92.3\%) recorded at 303 K for 500 ppm. The mixed-type
               inhibitory effect of NVAIP was substantiated by the polarization
               test results. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm model accorded
               with the metal surface evaluated, and Gibbs free energy of
               adsorption values ranged from - 35.05 to-36.05 kJ/mol, implying a
               physical and chemical adsorption mechanism. Surface morphological
               analysis was carried out to characterize the chemical composition
               of the adsorbed inhibitor on the MS surface, and these techniques
               confirmed that the inhibitive layer is composed of an iron
               oxide/hydroxide mixture where NVAIP molecules are incorporated.
               Further, the physicochemical and electronic properties of the
               NVAIP were investigated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and
               electrostatic potential energy mapping (ESP). ΔEads value of
               −57.21 kcal/mol obtained from Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations
               correlates well with the experimental results. Moreover, the

               rates (200 kg ha−1, 160 kg ha−1 and 120 kg ha−1) of granular DAP
               fertilizer were determined to fit the low, medium and high soil

               restricted range of δ34S values (from 2.1 to 4.7‰, average 3.7‰,
               n = 19). Three subtypes of pyrite (Py3a–Py3c) and two subtypes of
               arsenopyrite (Apy2a–Apy2b) from stage 3 have relatively low Au
               concentrations (up to 95.1 and 64.9 ppm for pyrite and
               arsenopyrite, respectively), and show a narrow variation in δ34S
               values (from –2.5 to 3.7‰, average 0.8‰, n = 22). These data
               suggest that magmatic-hydrothermal ore-forming fluids contribute
               to most of the Au and S budget in the Longshan Sb-Au deposit. The
               major differences between mineralization in terms of texture,
               trace elements, and S isotopic compositions of pyrite and
               arsenopyrite can reflect contrasting mechanisms of Au
               precipitation and provide implications for the genesis of this
               intrusion-related Sb-Au deposit. The new data underpin the
               importance of performing complementary in-situ mineralogical
               analyses to elucidate the source and evolution of ore-forming
               fluids and enable correct interpretation of the hydrothermal

               scenarios is essential to quantify our ability to feed a growing
               population and develop agronomic adaptations to meet future food
               demand. A coordinated evaluation of yield simulations from
               process-based eco-physiological models for climate change impact
               assessment is still missing for soybean, the most widely grown
               grain legume and the main source of protein in our food chain. In
               this first soybean multi-model study, we used ten prominent
               models capable of simulating soybean yield under varying
               temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration [CO2] to quantify
               the uncertainty in soybean yield simulations in response to these
               factors. Models were first parametrized with high quality
               measured data from five contrasting environments. We found
               considerable variability among models in simulated yield
               responses to increasing temperature and [CO2]. For example, under
               a + 3 °C temperature rise in our coolest location in Argentina,
               some models simulated that yield would reduce as much as 24\%,
               while others simulated yield increases up to 29\%. In our warmest
               location in Brazil, the models simulated a yield reduction
               ranging from a 38\% decrease under + 3 °C temperature rise to no
               effect on yield. Similarly, when increasing [CO2] from 360 to 540
               ppm, the models simulated a yield increase that ranged from 6\%
               to 31\%. Model calibration did not reduce variability across
               models but had an unexpected effect on modifying yield responses
               to temperature for some of the models. The high uncertainty in
               model responses indicates the limited applicability of individual
               models for climate change food projections. However, the ensemble
               mean of simulations across models was an effective tool to reduce
               the high uncertainty in soybean yield simulations associated with
               individual models and their parametrization. Ensemble, ensemble
               mean yield responses to temperature and [CO2] were similar to
               those reported from the literature. Our study is the first
               demonstration of the benefits achieved from using an ensemble of
               grain legume models for climate change food projections, and
               highlights that further soybean model development with

               candidate for the electro-oxidation of organic compounds in
               wastewater treatment systems. The catalytic activity of this
               material depends on its surface morphology, which strongly
               depends on the synthesis method used. Hence, here we manufactured
               innovative Ti/SnO2–Sb2O5–IrO2 anodes using micelle templates made
               of amphiphilic block-copolymers and compared them with anodes
               made of the same composition using the Pechini method. Scanning
               electron microscopy, X-ray dispersive energy analysis, X-ray
               diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance
               spectroscopy were used to characterise the morphology,
               composition, and electrochemical properties of the developed
               anodes. The “template method” produces anodes with mesoporous
               surfaces (11.0 ± 4 nm of pore diameter), which enhanced the
               electroactive area compared with the anodes made through the
               Pechini method. The templated anodes are more conductive than the
               Pechini-made ones and are more active for removing the reactive
               black 5-dye from 0.1 mol dm−3 Na2SO4 aqueous solutions. The
               enhanced catalytic activity of the templated anode strongly
               increases with the addition of low concentrations of NaCl. The
               rate constants increase 3.9 and 4.7-fold when adding 200 ppm and
               1168.8-ppm chloride, respectively. The templated anode removes
               100\% of the dye after only 15 min of electrolysis applying 20 mA
               cm−2 and leads to ∼50\% mineralization after 60 min of oxidation.
               Notably, the template anode is 3-fold more stable in accelerated
               service lifetime tests than the Pechini-made anode. Therefore,
               our study shows that Ti/SnO2–Sb2O5–IrO2 anodes made using the
               template method are highly promising for the electrochemical

               with a view to understand the age and genesis of the Huangshui'an
               deposit. Three types of pyrite are identified in the Huangshui'an
               deposit as follows: (i) Py1a is composed of irregular pyrite in
               stage Ia carbonatite dykes; (ii) the euhedral Py1b coexists with
               sphalerite and galena in the margin of stage Ia carbonatite
               dykes; and (iii) Py2 occurs as irregular and anhedral grains in
               the fluorite + quartz veins. The highly variable Co (Py1a =
               0.032–3230 ppm; Py1b = 0.053–779 ppm; Py2 = 0.98–164 ppm) and Ni

               ppm) indicate heterogeneous material sources. The δ34S values of
               the various pyrite types range between −9.6‰ and −3.5‰, and the
               obviously negative values resulted from sulfur isotope
               fractionation between sulfide and sulfate minerals. The total
               δ34S value calculated from co-genetic galena and barite is
               −0.11‰, in combination with previous Sr-Nd-Pb-He-Ar isotopes,

               with an additional contribution through partial melting of the
               thickened lower crust. In situ bastnäsite U-Th-Pb dating results
               yield mean ages of 211.7 ± 3.1 Ma and 209.6 ± 2.1 Ma,
               representing the timing of Mo-Pb-REE mineralization in the

               from the enriched mantle and the thickened lower crust, and the

               Moreover, CO2adsorption and desorption kinetics are enhanced by

               α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles and coagulation-flocculation with
               polyacrylamide, to investigate the effects on COD removal in
               alcohol vinasse. Highly porous α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were
               prepared via a chemical precipitation technique. The
               characteristic of the synthesized α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were
               determined by FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy, XRD, SEM, and N2
               adsorption-desorption isotherms. The effect of different α-Fe2O3
               nanoparticles loading for chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal
               efficiency was investigated. The results revealed that at α-Fe2O3
               nanoparticle dose of 3000 ppm had the highest COD removal for
               vinasse. Then, central composite design (CCD) was used to
               optimize the operating variables such as pH, time, oxidant
               dosage, and coagulant dosage, and their optimum values were
               determined to be pH:7.36, 90 min, 17.89 wt\% oxidant dosage, and
               1.6 wt\% coagulant dosage, to achieve a high COD removal
               efficiency in 70 ℃ for alcohol vinasse (98.64\%). Based on
               optimal conditions, the porous α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles possess
               superior catalytic activity in the advanced oxidation process
               compared to other treating methods. Also, the mechanism of the

               wastewater treatment process has become a major problem.
               Al-Rustumiya WWTP in Baghdad city needs to have an environmental
               impact assessment study to know the potential impacts on
               environment. The laboratory work continued from 2019 to February
               2020. Many samples were collected from wastewater, and from air,
               and soil surrounding wastewater basins, for the examination of
               many variables parameters: pH, BOD, COD, TSS, and Cl from
               wastewater; H2S, CO, and SO2 from the air, and pH, TDS, OM,
               Gypsum, SO4, and Cl from the soil. From results the BOD, COD, and

               BOD5/COD ratio of 0.5 for raw water, 0.4 to effluent, indicate
               that wastewater needed more treatment. For air results, the H2S

               Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), and contact angle (CA)
               goniometer. The separation performance of the membrane for drying
               ethanol by pervaporation was also investigated and compared with
               a standard membrane (PERVAP™ 4100) under same operating
               conditions. The results show that the new membrane is thinner and
               less cross-linked than the standard one. The water permeance in
               PERVAP™ 4100HF (∼800 GPU) is four-time higher than that in
               PERVAP™ 4100 (200 GPU) at 70 °C and for <5 wt.\% of water
               concentration in the feed. The water/ethanol selectivity of the
               new membrane under this operating condition is very high (∼7000).
               The effect of feed water concentration on the Arrhenius
               activation energy was also investigated to evaluate the mass
               transfer through the membrane under other operating conditions,
               like higher temperatures and lower feed water concentrations.
               Simulation results confirmed that optimizing the operating
               temperature, the new membrane exhibits outstanding separation
               performance for drying ethanol below 500 ppm of water. Lastly,
               the ethanol drying process using the PERVAP™ membranes is
               compared with a molecular sieve system. Although the new membrane
               can easily dry ethanol below 500 ppm of water, a hybrid system
               consisting of pervaporation followed by molecular sieves leads to
               an interesting process solution, e.g., for a feed flow of 1000
               kg/h, the required membrane area and the quantity of molecular
               sieves can be reduced from 650 m2 to 250 m2 (2.6 times less), and
               from 2252 kg to 204 kg (11 times less), respectively. Therefore,
               the ethanol drying process can be greatly optimized in terms of
               capital costs and energy when using a hybrid system instead of
               using pervaporation or molecular sieve system alone. © 2022

               large multicity studies have evaluated the acute short-term
               health effects of ambient non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), the
               essential precursors of ground-level ozone and secondary organic
               aerosol formation. Objective: We conducted this multicity
               time-series study in Taiwan to evaluate the association between
               airborne NMHC exposure and cardiorespiratory hospital admissions.
               Methods: We collected the daily mean concentrations of NMHC, fine
               particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), weather conditions, and
               daily hospital admission count for cardiorespiratory diseases
               between 2014 and 2017 from eight major cities of Taiwan. We
               applied an over-dispersed generalized additive Poisson model
               (GAM) with adjustment for temporal trends, seasonal variations,
               weather conditions, and calendar effects to compute the effect
               estimate for each city. Then we conducted a random-effects
               meta-analysis to pool the eight city-specific effect estimates to
               obtain the overall associations of NMHC exposure on lag0 day with
               hospital admissions for respiratory and circulatory diseases,
               respectively. Results: On average, a 0.1-ppm increase of lag0
               NMHC demonstrated an overall 0.9\% (95\% CI: 0.4–1.3\%) and 0.8\%
               (95\% CI: 0.4–1.2\%) increment of hospital admissions for
               respiratory and circulatory diseases, respectively. Further
               analyses with adjustment for PM2.5 and O3 in the multi-pollutant
               model or sensitivity analyses with restricting the NMHC
               monitoring from the general stations only confirmed the
               robustness of the association between ambient NMHC exposure and
               cardiorespiratory hospitalizations. Conclusion: Our findings
               provide robust evidence of higher cardiorespiratory

               milk/kg DMI) and milk energy secretion to digestible OM intake
               (DOMI) (1.47 vs 1.30 Mcal/kg) were decreased in GLY. There was no
               difference between treatments on rumen microbial yield, estimated
               by the daily excretion of urinary allantoin, and urinary
               allantoin per unit of DOMI. Eating time per unit of DMI was
               reduced for cows fed GLY (12.6 vs 14.2 min/kg DMI) and rumination
               rate did not differ between treatments (18.2 min/kg DMI).
               Overall, the substitution of ground corn with a crude glycerin

               However, the specific mechanism of Cd-induced testicular damage
               remains unclear. We investigated whether Cd causes testicular
               injury through ferroptosis. Male C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to
               0, 0.5, or 5 ppm Cd via drinking water, starting in utero, and
               continuing through 24 weeks post-weaning. The results showed that
               Cd accumulated in the testes in a dose-dependent manner. Cd
               exposure at a concentration of 5 ppm, but not 0.5 ppm, caused a
               mass loss and detachment of germ cells, as well as a decreased
               meiotic index and testis weight. Exposure to 5 ppm Cd caused iron
               accumulation, increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitro
               tyrosine (3-NT), and decreased expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and SOD2.
               We also found that exposure to 5 ppm Cd significantly decreased
               the expression of SLC7A11, a marker of ferroptosis in mice, along
               with the expression of SLC40A1 mRNA and ferritin heavy chain

               indicate that 5 ppm Cd exposure increased testicular ferroptosis,

               learning outcomes. Prolonged periods of air conditioner use in
               enclosed classrooms may result in poor air quality. However,
               opening classroom windows may expose students to air pollutants
               if the outdoor air quality is poor. This study investigated CO2
               and PM2.5 concentrations in 86 classrooms installed with air
               conditioners in elementary and middle schools in southern Taiwan,
               each additionally installed with a fresh air ventilation system
               equipped with an E11-class filter. Enclosed air-conditioned
               classrooms generally have a CO2 concentration greater than 2500
               ppm; occasionally, this figure reaches 3500 ppm. With the
               installed air ventilation system operating, the mean classroom
               CO2 concentration decreased to 1084 ± 203 ppm, and the median CO2
               concentration decreased to 1120 ppm. However, the CO2
               concentrations of over half the classrooms remained higher than
               the concentration advised by the World Health Organization (1000
               ppm). This high CO2 concentration was a result of the short
               distance (1.5–2 m) between the indoor air outlet and the
               recirculated air inlet resulting in a shortened circuit of air
               travel. Also, the initial filter installed over the indoor air
               outlet of the system reduced air penetration into the classroom.
               When the ventilation system was manually activated without
               activating the air conditioners, the median PM2.5 concentration
               measured at the indoor air outlet and the median classroom PM2.5
               concentration were 2 μg/m3 and 20 μg/m3, respectively. This
               implied the presence of other sources of PM2.5 in classrooms,
               particularly ceiling and wall-mounted fans. The activation of
               these fans spread dust onto classroom furniture. Overall, fresh
               air ventilation systems providing filtered air improve classroom
               ventilation efficiency and indoor air quality by reducing CO2 and
               PM2.5 concentrations, but the cleanliness of fans and furniture
               must be maintained. © 2022 Turkish National Committee for Air

               Fractions enriched with material reporting this signal were

               and subjected to analysis using mass spectrometry and NMR

               Rhodonite is a widespread skarn mineral in the host rock,
               occurring as coarse-grained crystals and veins, and is closely
               associated with Pb − Zn mineralization. In-situ elemental
               analysis of rhodonite from three levels (1220 m, 1265 m and 1495
               m above sea level) by laser ablation-inductively coupled
               plasma-mass spectrometry and Sm − Nd isotopic dating of the
               rhodonite − calcite pair were conducted to constrain the
               compositions and the timing of Pb − Zn mineralization. The new Sm
               − Nd isotopic data reveal that the Luziyuan deposit formed during
               the Early Jurassic (183 ± 2.3 Ma; MSWD = 0.72). These
               chronological constraints, combined with regional tectonic
               evolution, suggest that the Luziyuan Pb − Zn mineralization is
               genetically linked to eastward subduction of the Shan Boundary
               Ocean beneath the Baoshan block during the Meso-Tethys period.
               Furthermore, all examined rhodonite samples contain relatively
               high concentrations of MnO (34.7 − 43.0 wt\%) and Zn (536 − 2117
               ppm), but generally low contents of FeO (1.07 − 6.08 wt\%), Cu,

               and MnO contents among different skarn deposits and nearly
               chondritic Y/Ho ratio (~ 28) in the Luziyuan rhodonite suggests
               that this mineral formed from magmatic fluids and its Zn
               enrichment was controlled by the fluid chemistry. The same data
               also suggest that Zn-rich rhodonite in skarns may be used as an
               indicator mineral for Zn exploration when combined with other
               geological, geophysical, and geochemical criteria. © 2022, The

               attractive because of its non-explosive nature and high volume

               dual-function (thermodynamic and kinetic) promoter for hydrate
               formation. Herein, we investigate mixed CH4/DIOX (sII) hydrate
               formation at, a) elevated temperature conditions, and b)
               introducing 3 wt\% NaCl to the system (simulated seawater
               conditions). Hydrate formation from an aqueous solution
               containing 5.56 mol\% DIOX and 1000 ppm L-tryptophan resulted in
               an average final methane uptake of 99.76 (±2.85) (v/v; volume of
               gas at STP/volume of hydrate), when the experimental temperature
               and methane overpressure employed were 293.15 K and 6.6 MPa,
               respectively. This equates to 86.8\% of the theoretical limit for
               mixed CH4/DIOX (sII) hydrates. The average time required for 90\%
               completion of the gas uptake was only 39.89 (±0.96) min. For
               experiments conducted in the presence of 3.0 wt\% NaCl (a
               thermodynamic inhibitor), the final gas uptake was expectedly
               lower when compared to the counterpart freshwater system. This
               was somewhat offset by elevating the initial driving force and
               adding 1000 ppm of L-tryptophan. The rapid and high-volume
               methane uptake achieved at near ambient temperature significantly
               propels the viability of using the mixed CH4/DIOX system for
               hydrate based natural gas storage. However, further improvement

  abstract  = "Signals of volcanic unrest have been used successfully to provide
               insights into the timing, magnitude, intensity, and style of
               future eruptions. However, in order to provide context for the
               subsequent activity, analysis of past eruptions is required. This
               provides useful information in order to understand processes of
               magma genesis, storage, evolution and ascent which lead to the
               onset of eruptions. Here, we examine basaltic-andesitic to
               andesitic deposits from La Soufrière de Guadeloupe Holocene
               eruptions, covering a range of explosive eruption styles, ages
               and magnitudes. Our work is timely given unrest at this system
               has increased over the last 25 years, with a potential eruption
               capable of directly impacting up to 80,000 people in Southern
               Basse-Terre and potentially thousands more indirectly on a
               regional scale. We report on the geochemistry of pre-eruptive
               magmas using detailed analyses of glass (melt inclusions and
               groundmass glass) from four Holocene explosive eruptions: 1657
               Cal. CE (Vulcanian, VEI 2), 1530 Cal. CE (sub-Plinian, VEI 3),
               1010 Cal. CE (Plinian, VEI 4), and 5680 Cal. BCE (Plinian, VEI
               4). Major element concentrations vs SiO2 in whole rock (WR),
               groundmass glass (GM) and melt inclusions (MI) show a strong
               linear trend. MIs reveal a relatively homogenous melt composition
               from the first to the most recent eruptions, ranging from
               63.6–78.7 wt\% SiO2. Volatiles, including H2O (2.3–4.4 wt\%), CO2
               (35–866 ppm) and sulphur (30–202 ppm), are also consistent across
               the various eruptions. The major element and volatile
               compositional homogeneity across the eruptions indicates that
               composition and volatiles do not have a direct control on
               eruption explosivity at this system. Instead, we find differences
               in ascent rate, groundmass glass viscosity and microlite volume
               percentage, indicating that explosive eruptive style at La
               Soufrière is controlled by a combination of ascent rate and
               top-down controls affecting rock strength, stress distribution
               and the development of fluid overpressure. Rapid ascent in the
               absence of top-down controls (processes with a cause external to
               the magma but affecting the plumbing system) will result in
               explosive eruptions driven from the bottom-up (internal to magma
               dynamic response with varying pressure and temperature, e.g.,
               1010 Cal. CE in the case of very rapid ascent or 1657 Cal. CE in
               the case of rapid ascent). However, we also highlight the
               importance of top-down controls, such as conduit sealing which
               can promote the onset of explosive eruptions, even in the case of
               slow magma ascent (e.g., 5680 Cal. BCE). External effects
               (including ingress of water and rapid edifice unloading) can also
               favour explosive eruptions with flank collapses involved in some
               scenarios (e.g., 1530 Cal. CE). The multiple controls on
               explosive eruption style make this system more hazardous and
               complex to model and monitor. In order to improve early-warning
               system efficiency, forecast models, eruption scenario crisis
               response and long-term risk reduction planning, we stress that
               internal processes such as fracture and host-rock sealing (fluid
               pore pressure) as well as external processes such as water moving
               into the system and the mechanical stability of the edifice
               should be monitored and modelled closely. © 2022",

  abstract  = "Background: Ten percent povidone-iodine (PVP-I) was initially
               promoted as ‘tamed iodine’ as the chemical activity of the active
               biocide, uncomplexed or free molecular iodine (I2), is reduced
               30- to 50-fold compared with Lugol's solution. The idea that I2
               is responsible for topical iodine staining and irritation remains
               widely held. However, there are no controlled studies that
               characterize the cytotoxicity and staining of the hydrophobic I2
               species compared with the other hydrophilic iodine species that
               comprise over 99.9\% of the total iodine in topical iodine
               disinfectants. Aims: To compare the staining properties of the I2
               species with other topical iodine disinfectants; to evaluate if
               the concentrations of I2 in diluted PVP-I used to reduce severe
               acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in the nasal cavity are
               potentially cytotoxic; and to determine if high concentrations of
               I2 can be delivered beyond the stratum corneum into the
               hypodermis, which could provide a mechanistic rationale for I2
               out-gassing. Methods: Five liquid compositions that contained
               complexed and uncomplexed (free) I2 in aqueous and non-aqueous
               carriers were used to evaluate the interaction of I2 with
               mammalian cells in culture as well as human and pig skin.
               Findings: Concentrations of I2 (7800 ppm) that are 1500 times
               higher than that found in PVP-I can be applied to skin without
               irritation and staining. I2 is not cytotoxic at concentrations
               >100 times higher than that found in PVP-I, and does not
               contribute materially to staining of skin at concentrations found
               in Lugol's solution (approximately 170 ppm). I2 can partition
               into hypodermis tissue, remain there for hours and out-gas from
               skin. PVP-I and Lugol's solution are highly effective topical
               disinfectants, but do not facilitate diffusion of I2 through the
               stratum corneum. Conclusion: The maximum concentration of I2
               found in diluted PVP, approximately 25 ppm, is not cytotoxic or
               irritating. The potential clinical utility of I2 has been limited
               by incorporating this broad-spectrum biocide into acidic aqueous
               formulations that contain numerous chemical species that
               contribute toxicity but not biocidal activity. I2 can be
               delivered topically into hypodermis tissue without irritation. ©

               relevant changes in particle size distribution at least up to 4
               months. The highest concentration of M. longifolia EO was the

               O. surinamensis, and 87.8\% and 67.8\% mortality to A. siro
               adults and nymphs, respectively. Tribolium castaneum larvae were
               controlled by 500 ppm of the EO and 1000 ppm of the NE, which
               caused 100\% and 93.3\% mortality, respectively. Similarly, 1000
               ppm NE caused 96.7\% mortality against T. confusum larvae, while
               500 ppm EO and 1000 ppm NE killed 90.0\% and 91.1\% of T. molitor
               adults, respectively. Complete mortality (100\%) of O.
               surinamensis adults was achieved by 500 ppm EO. The findings of

               high economic values. The authors observed, for the first time,
               high abundance of spherical polymetallic nodules on the abyssal
               basin around the Caiwei Guyot in the northwestern Pacific Ocean.
               In order to reveal their metal resource potential and long-term
               metallogenic process, the authors carried out high-resolution
               scanning electron microscopy (SEM), laser ablation inductively
               coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), X-ray diffraction
               (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of laminas, and
               marine chemical analysis. The polymetallic nodules are composed
               of columnar or lamina growth patterns with low reflectance, which
               can be subdivided into four types of laminas based on
               microtexture. The Mn/Fe ratios of the laminas increased in the
               order type 1.2 < type 1.3 < type 2 < type 1.1. The nodule laminas
               yielded low Mn/Fe ratios (<4.01), Ni (<12000 ppm) and MgO
               (<3.74\%) contents but high contents of Co (average 8516 ppm), Pt
               (average 416 ppb), and rare earth elements and Y (REY, average
               2887 ppm), relative to other polymetallic nodules in the global
               ocean. XRD and TEM analyses indicated that the polymetallic
               nodules are composed of Fe-vernadite. Evidences from
               micro-texture, geochemistry and mineralogy imply that the
               polymetallic nodules around the Caiwei Guyot have been forming
               from oxic bottom water since initial growth, due to oxygen-rich
               bottom water flowing-through and low surface productivity. The
               dissolved Mn and Fe elements in the bottom water are continuously
               precipitated into ferromanganese oxides under oxic conditions.
               The ferromanganese oxides absorb high contents of multivalent
               metals such as Co, Pt, and Ce, owing to surface oxidation of the
               manganate octahedral layer during precipitation. The northwest
               Pacific Ocean shows deep depth, slow sedimentary rates,
               moderate-to-high contents of dissolved oxygen, and low summer
               surface productivity. Based on this, the authors propose that the
               northwest Pacific Ocean is an ideal metallogenic belt for
               polymetallic nodules with abundant Co, Pt, and REY resources. ©

               Study: Consecutive patients who underwent upper endoscopy at our
               center were prospectively enrolled. During the endoscopy
               procedure, gastric juice was aspirated to perform an automatic
               analysis by EndoFaster and gastric biopsies were taken.
               Histologic sections were reviewed to assess the histopathologic
               features. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
               value, and negative predictive value were calculated for the
               EndoFaster test, Diff-Quick (DQ), and immunohistochemistry
               against HP (anti-HP) using Warthin-Starry as the gold standard
               for HP detection. Results: Overall, 80 patients were enrolled. In
               19 cases (23,75\%), histology was normal. In the remaining cases,
               varying degrees of inflammation were found. The sensitivity,
               specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive
               value were 73.33\%, 86.00\%, 75.86\%, and 84.31\% for the
               EndoFaster test using 67 ppm/mL as the positive threshold;
               73.33\%, 100\%, 100\%, and 86.21\% for DQ; and 79.31\%, 88.00\%,
               79.31\%, and 88.00\% for anti-HP, respectively. Conclusions: The
               EndoFaster test has good sensitivity and specificity for the
               diagnosis of HP during the gastroscopy procedure. DQ and anti-HP
               are excellent alternatives to Warthin-Starry for the detection of
               HP. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.",

               initial ion concentration of 10 ppm and a temperature of 25 ºC.
               The data obtained in the adsorption of Cd2+ and Pb2+ best fitted

               lamprophyres in the Lüchun-Jinping microblock. The lamprophyres
               yield zircon U–Pb ages of 34.7–33.3 Ma and exhibit
               potassic-ultrapotassic features with elevated K2O/Na2O (1.4–4.0)
               ratios. They are characterized by high concentrations of
               compatible elements (e.g., Cr = 187–692 ppm, Ni = 31–218 ppm),
               large-ion-lithophile elements and light rare-earth elements
               enrichment, high-field-strength elements depletion, and high
               radiogenic isotopic values, i.e. (87Sr/86Sr)i = 0.7063–0.7078 and
               εNd(t) = −3.9 to −2.4. Combined with the low Nb/U ratios, these
               features suggest that the lithospheric mantle source was
               metasomatized by subduction-related fluids beneath the
               Lüchun-Jinping microblock. The relatively high Rb/Sr ratios and
               high heavy rare-earth element contents indicate that these
               lamprophyres were derived from partial melting of a
               phlogopite-bearing lherzolite within the spinel stability field.
               The parental magmas have experienced fractional crystallization
               of olivine and clinopyroxene during emplacement. Comprehensive
               comparisons between the lamprophyres from the Lüchun-Jinping
               microblock and the potassic-ultrapotassic mafic rocks from the
               western Yangtze Craton indicate that the Lüchun-Jinping
               microblock can be regarded as a dismembered part of the western
               Yangtze Craton due to continental extrusion and Cenozoic
               sinistral displacement. The compositional trends of the

               attracted intense attention in sensing field. However, most of
               the traditional metallic terahertz (THz) metasurfaces are limited
               in application for their high thermal conductivity, low melting
               point, complicated design and fabrication. Here, we proposed two
               different types of all-silicon multi-band THz metasurface with
               rectangular holes for sensing applications. The periodic
               multi-band metasurface sensor (PMMS) and the non-periodic
               multi-band metasurface sensor (NMMS) were designed and
               fabricated. The absorption characteristics and the resonance
               mechanism were studied. Both the PMMS and NMMS can achieve more
               than 90\% multi-band resonance absorption. As a demonstration of
               the sensing applications of PMMS, three different saccharides
               (fructose, glucose, and sucrose) with the same concentration were
               investigated experimentally. Furthermore, different
               concentrations of 2, 4-D solutions were detected by the proposed
               NMMS, and the sensitivity achieved 2.76✕10−2 THz/ppm. The

               Cu-doping in Co3O4. The sensitivity towards both types of gases
               arises due to presence of Co2+ and Co3+ cations in the (nearly)
               normal spinel structure of Co3O4. Pellets made up of nanopowders
               were employed for the detection of ∼6.5 ppm CO gas present in
               either pure N2 or in a mixture of synthetic air as carrier gas
               (which represents the O2 sensing-gas too). The high sensitivity
               of Co3O4 nanoparticles to detect ∼6 ppm CO (in N2) arises due to
               the high surface area of nanopowders exposing a higher number of
               octahedral Co3+ cations as adsorption sites, whereas the
               sensitivity towards O2 arises due to partial presence (less

               octahedrally Cu2+ substituted Co3O4 specimens are investigated.
               The inactive Cu2+ at the octahedral site changes the unexposed
               tetrahedral Co2+ into Co3+. The presence of inactive Cu2+ at the
               octahedral site and the burial of the Co3+ at the tetrahedral
               sites reduce the adsorption sites for O2, thereby drastically

               because they are less prone to dissolution, in comparison with
               bones. However, despite this apparent resistance, teeth do
               undergo diagenesis, which needs to be accounted for in order to
               obtain accurate ages. In particular, the uptake of trace elements
               such as uranium in dental tissues needs to be considered for dose
               rate determination when dated using electron spin resonance
               (ESR). Characterising the mineralogy and structural integrity of
               samples prior to dating may thus provide important information
               related to their state of preservation, especially in the case of
               teeth whose U content can significantly affect the dose rate. In
               this study, we dated five teeth of small-sized bovids using
               combined ESR/U-series dating. They were collected at the Middle
               Stone Age site of Lovedale, located in the central interior of
               South Africa. Micromorphology provided sedimentary context to the
               samples, which were recovered from a layer of gravel rich in
               faunal remains. Using cathodoluminescence, laser-induced
               fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman
               micro-spectroscopy we assessed the degree of preservation of the
               enamel. Results reveal that carbonate hydroxyapatite underwent
               post-depositional alteration, based on its molecular structure
               and elemental composition. Although the teeth all originate from
               the same layer and were sampled in the same 1-m square and at a
               similar elevation, U-content in the enamel differs highly from
               one tooth to the other, with values ranging from 1.7 to 29.6 ppm.
               These values are correlated with equivalent doses (De) from 228
               to 923 Gy and are consistent with variations in crystallinity
               determined with vibrational spectroscopy. We also investigated
               the possible saturation of the ESR signal, by repeating
               measurements with microwave power values from 1 to 20 mW. Despite
               such diversity in U-content, the ages calculated assuming an
               early uptake of U all fall within the same range, from 63 ± 8 ka

               concentration dataset with high-spatiotemporal resolution was
               generated based on satellite CO2 observations and environmental
               factors in this study. First, the environmental factors affecting
               atmospheric CO2 concentrations were selected, and by integrating
               the atmospheric CO2 concentration data observed by the OCO-2
               satellite, a sample dataset was created. The extreme random tree
               (ERT) model was then trained to determine the relationship
               between environmental factors and atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
               Finally, spatiotemporally continuous atmospheric CO2
               concentration data (0.01° and 8-day resolution) over the global
               continent were generated based on the established ERT model and

               atmospheric CO2 concentration observations indicated that the

               performance with coefficients of determination and root mean

               countries. Exposure to Cr(VI) predisposes the human population to
               various diseases, including cancer, infertility, and
               developmental problems in children. Previous findings from our
               laboratory reported that prenatal exposure to Cr(VI) caused
               premature ovarian failure through p53-mediated mechanisms.
               Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is an NAD+ -dependent histone deacetylase class
               III. SIRT1 deacetylates several histones and non-histone proteins
               such as p53 and NFkB. The current study determines a role for the
               SIRT1-p53 network in apoptosis induced by Cr(VI) in the ovary and
               establishes physical interaction between SIRT1 and p53. Adult
               pregnant dams were given regular drinking water or Cr(VI) (10 ppm
               potassium dichromate in drinking water, ad libitum), and treated
               with SIRT1 inhibitor, EX-527 (50 mg/kg body weight, i.p.,),
               during 9.5 − 14.5 days post-coitum. On postnatal day-1, ovaries
               from F1 offspring were collected for various analyses. Results
               indicated that Cr(VI) increased germ cell and somatic cell
               apoptosis, upregulated acetyl-p53, activated the apoptotic
               pathway, and inhibited cell survival pathways. Cr(VI) decreased
               acetyl-p53-SIRT1 co-localization in the ovary. In an immortalized
               rat granulosa cell line SIGC, Cr(VI) inhibited the physical
               interaction between SIRT1 and acetyl-p53 by altering the
               p53:SIRT1 ratio. EX-527 exacerbated Cr(VI)-induced mechanisms.
               The current study shows a novel mechanism for Cr(VI)-induced
               apoptosis in the ovary, mediated through the p53-SIRT1 network,
               suggesting that targeting the p53 pathway may be an ideal

               contrast that is predominantly dependent on tissue intracellular
               pHi. The AACID value is linearly related to the ratio of the 3.5
               ppm amide CEST effect and the 2.75 ppm amine CEST effect in the
               physiological range. However, the amine CEST effect at 2 ppm is
               often more clearly defined in vivo, and may provide greater
               sensitivity to pH changes. The purpose of the current study was
               to compare AACID measurement precision utilizing the 2.0 and 2.75
               ppm amine CEST effects. We hypothesized that the 2.0 ppm amine
               CEST resonance would produce measurements with greater
               sensitivity to pH changes. In the current study, we compare the
               range of the AACID values obtained in 24 mice with brain tumors

               The AACID measurement range increased by 39\% when using the 2
               ppm amine resonance compared to the 2.75 ppm resonance, with
               decreased measurement variability across the brain. These data
               indicate that in vivo pH measurements made using AACID CEST can
               be enhanced by incorporating the 2 ppm amine resonance. This
               approach should be considered for pH measurements made over short
               intervals when no changes are expected in the concentration of

               Cr, Cu, Na, Sc, V, Zn), most other olivine-hosted trace elements

               other mineral inclusions (e.g., U, Th) rather than enrichments of
               these elements due to substitution reactions or analytical
               artefacts. We interpret that these inclusions occur in olivine
               throughout the garnet stability field, but are relatively rare.
               As a result, these trapped carbonatitic, proto-kimberlite, and/or

               The study revealed that total CO2 emissions throughout the world
               since the 1960s have been increasing rapidly and in the recent
               year the net CO2 increasing rate is 2.11\% annually. If the

               selective catalytic reduction of NOx by NH3 (NH3-SCR) are
               essential for the purification of non-isothermal emission such as
               vehicle exhaust. However, NH3-SCR catalyst with high
               low-temperature performance has excellent NO activation and
               oxidation ability, leading inevitably to NH3-intermediates
               over-oxidation and N2 selectivity deterioration at high operation
               temperatures. By far the best performance ceria-based catalyst
               with a super-wide temperature window of 175–400 oC for 90\% NOx
               conversion in ideal environment and 225–475 oC for 90\% NOx
               conversion by addition of 50 ppm SO2 and 5\% H2O is obtained via
               distributing phosphate over the outer of ceria. NH3 protection
               strategy is the key for keeping high-temperature activity.
               Brønsted acidity surged as the formation of P-OH network via a
               charge compensatory mechanism of phosphate. NH3 was prone to be
               captured by the surface P-OH network, forming NH4+ species,
               avoiding being oxidized and contributing to both low and high
               temperature activity. NO can also be readily absorbed and
               oxidized to the absorbed NO2(ad) species over phosphate as
               reflected by in situ DRIFTS and DFT calculation, providing a
               facile pathway for ‘fast SCR’ by reacting with NH4+ species to
               form N2 and H2O. The reaction followed the L-H mechanism and
               contributed to catalytic activity under 300 oC. This directional
               structure fabricate strategy helps to increases the NOx
               conversion and N2 selectivity under a broaden temperature window.
               The enriched Brønsted acid sites over phosphate treated ceria
               were also demonstrated to have largely suppressed SO2 adsorption,
               which significantly slowed down the catalyst poisoning. A dynamic
               equilibrium between the poisoning and regeneration process can be
               achieved according to the shrinking-core model for each

               superior for long-term purification of indoor low-concentration
               volatile organic compounds (VOCs). To further improve the
               adsorption kinetics of the films, the surface morphology of
               adsorption films was suggested in hierarchical channel structure.
               However, such structure is far from practical applications
               because of its complicated fabrication method and limited
               flexibility. In this study, we proposed a convenient and fast
               method named direct ink writing (DIW) based 3D printing to
               fabricate flexible adsorption films. Inks were prepared to have
               appropriate rheological properties and good printability. Three
               types of adsorption film (flat, straight finned, and trough-like
               finned) were constructed on flexible polyimide circuit substrates
               by DIW. We utilized the printed adsorption films for indoor level
               (1 ppm) formaldehyde removal. The trough-like finned film
               achieved the best performance among the three printed films,
               showing a 275\% longer penetration time and 252\% larger
               effective adsorption capacity than the flat film. By conducting a
               7-cycle adsorption-desorption experiment (more than 12 h), we
               verified that the films’ adsorption performance could effectively
               recover via in-situ heating. This work could dance around the
               complicated coating process, increase the structural flexibility
               and reduce the adsorbent interfacial modification cost. © 2022

               Geochemically, the Gleibat Lafhouda dolomite carbonatites are
               characterized by a compositional range of 11.3–27.1 wt\% MgO,

               Zr, and Hf. Nb and Ta show, however, much higher concentrations
               ranging from 0.5 ppm to 1.0 wt\%, and < 0.0 to 199 ppm,
               respectively, which set them apart from naturally occurring
               carbonatites and the experimentally derived carbonated melts. The

               20.7‰) and radiogenic 87Sr/86Srin (0.7032–0.7046), 143Nd/144Ndin

               predominantly depleted mantle source in a rift-related

               This study provides a structured approach to determine these
               criteria. Tryptic hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin
               and β-casein were analysed manually and automatically, using an
               UPLC-PDA-MS method for untargeted identification and absolute
               label-free quantification of peptides. A lock mass with two
               components was introduced resulting in an average mass error of 1
               ppm. Processing filters were set to ensure reliable annotations
               based on MS/MS fragmentation, while maintaining maximum amount of
               information. Peptides in the individual hydrolysates with an MS
               intensity above the limit of annotation represented 99\% of total
               MS intensity and were 100\% consistently annotated between four
               replicates. Amino acid and peptide sequence coverages for the
               individual protein hydrolysates were 99–100\% and 89–95\%,
               respectively. Mixing the hydrolysates resulted in a loss of 11\%
               of the peptide annotations above the LOA and lower
               reproducibility (97\%) for the remaining annotations, as well as
               more co-eluting peptides. Calculated concentrations of co-eluting
               peptides in mixed hydrolysates varied 37 ± 21\% from the value
               for single hydrolysates. The proposed approach allows complete

               prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method. A series of results
               through material characterization technologies showed the
               addition of polypeptides can effectively change the morphology
               and size of In2O3/ZnO crystals, and effectively improve the
               sensing performance of the gas sensors. Due to the single shape
               and small size, In2O3/ZnO composite modified by polypeptides
               increased the active sites on the surface. At the same time, the
               gas sensing properties of four different ratios of
               polypeptide-modified In2O3/ZnO gas sensors were tested. It was
               found that the In2O3/ZnO-10 material showed the highest response,
               excellent selectivity, and good stability at room temperature
               under UV light. In addition, the response of the In2O3/ZnO-10 gas
               sensor showed a strong linear relationship with the NO2 gas
               concentration. When the NO2 gas concentration was 20 ppm, the
               response time was as quick as 19 s, and the recovery time was 57
               s. Finally, based on the obtained experimental characterization
               results and energy band structure analysis, a possible gas
               sensing mechanism is proposed. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

               concerns are hematotoxicity, respiratory and reproductive

               products containing one or several glycol ethers that evaporate
               or if sprayed, generate aerosols that can be inhaled. The rate at
               which glycol ethers enters blood following inhalation exposure
               are unknown in humans, and chemical risk assessors only rely on
               animal and in vitro toxicity studies. Propylene glycol monomethyl
               ether (PGME) and propylene glycol monobutyl ether (PGBE) are two
               examples of glycol ethers used worldwide. Our study aimed to
               provide human toxicokinetic data after inhalation exposure of low
               PGME and PGBE concentrations tested alone or in mixture. Healthy
               participants (n = 28) were exposed to 35 ppm (131 mg/m3) of PGME
               and 15 ppm (i.e., 83 mg/m3) of PGBE for 2 or 6 h. Blood was
               regularly collected during the exposure sessions. PGME and PGBE
               were immediately bioavailable in blood during exposure, and the
               mean absorption rates were up to 13 μg/L/min and 2.45 μg/L/min,
               respectively. Maximum mean blood concentration (Cmax) was 2.91

               carrier and carbon-free fuel to tackle the issue of greenhouse
               gas (GHG) emissions from transportation. In this study, an
               ammonia/diesel dual-fuel (ADDF) engine is experimentally and
               numerically investigated, with focus on its feasibility to reduce
               GHG emissions while achieving a diesel-like efficiency. A
               single-cylinder, heavy-duty diesel engine is used to investigate
               the effect of ammonia energy fraction and start of diesel
               injection (SODI) timing on the combustion performance and
               emissions of the ADDF engine. Results revealed that due to the
               low flame speed of ammonia, increasing the ammonia energy
               fraction decreased the thermal efficiency of the ADDF combustion
               mode compared to the diesel-only combustion mode. Increasing
               ammonia energy fraction from 0 to 40\% reduced the nitrogen
               oxides (NOx) emissions by 58.8\% at a given SODI due to the
               effect of the thermal DeNOx process. However, increasing the
               ammonia energy fraction at a given SODI increased the nitrous
               oxide (N2O) emissions, which offsets the benefit of lower
               intrinsic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of ADDF combustion and
               resulted in a higher GHG emission compared to diesel-only
               combustion. Advancing SODI helped reduce the N2O and overall GHG
               emissions while achieving a diesel-like thermal efficiency in
               ADDF combustion mode. The lowest GHG emissions of ADDF combustion
               achieved by advancing the SODI were 12\% lower compared to those
               of diesel-only combustion. The thermal efficiency of ADDF
               combustion mode at the optimum point of GHG emissions (i.e., ITE
               = 37.85\%) was slightly lower than that of the diesel-only
               combustion mode (i.e., ITE = 38.53\%). This, however, comes with
               a benefit of 10\% and 20\% reduction in NOx and CO emissions,
               respectively. The unburned ammonia concentration is high (i.e.,
               about 4445 ppm) in the exhaust flow. The reduction of ammonia
               emissions in the exhaust flow should be further investigated in

               issue in steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) process for
               extracting bitumen from oil sands deposits has received much
               attention from oil industry. In view of low capital investment
               and exceptional antifouling performance, adding antifoulants has
               emerged as a promising strategy for addressing fouling issues.
               Developing an efficient method to evaluate their antifouling
               performance under production conditions is urgently needed. In
               this work, we report a novel bench-scale test method for
               quantitatively evaluating the antifouling performance of
               antifoulants under high temperature and high pressure (HTHP),
               close to SAGD operation conditions. The effects of antifoulant
               dosage and stirring rate on the antifouling performance are
               systematically investigated. The underlying fouling and
               antifouling mechanisms are characterized through direct molecular
               and surface force measurements. It is found that the commercial
               antifoulant exhibits exceptional antifouling performance at the
               dosage range of 20–35 ppm, and increasing stirring rate enhances
               the antifouling behavior. The force measurement results indicate
               that the antifoulant can adsorb to organics and target substrate
               surfaces, performing the antifouling function by lowering the
               hydrophobic interaction between organics and target substrates.
               This work provides a novel and feasible method for characterizing
               fouling phenomena and evaluating antifoulants under HTHP

               prevention and extinguishing materials in coal mines, A new
               biomass sodium alginate gel foam (SC-GF) was prepared by using
               sodium alginate (SA), calcium L-lactate (CL), alkyl glycoside
               (APG) and tea saponin (TS). The effect of different
               concentrations of CL on the properties of SC-GF was analyzed by
               studying the gelation time, foaming volume and half-life of the
               SC-GF. The results show that the gelation time of SC-GF is
               successfully controlled by using the weak electrolyte CL as the
               cross-linking agent. When SA: CL: APG: TS = 4 : 1 : 2 : 1, the
               gelation time of SC-GF is 10 min with half-life of 16 days.
               Furthermore, A metal coordination bond favorable to the stability
               of SC-GF is formed by the carboxylate ion of α-L-gulonic acid in
               SA and Ca2+ ionized by CL. SC-GF exhibits excellent fire
               prevention and extinguishing properties. The CO concentration of
               the coal sample treated with SC-GF decreases from 7556.8 to 34.92
               ppm in the process of oxidation at room temperature for 48 h. The
               temperature-programmed oxidation test shows that SC-GF can delay
               the accelerated oxidation temperature from 120 to 160 °C, and the
               CO inhibition rate is as high as 60.5 \% at 200 °C. The fire
               extinguishing test indicates that SC-GF can significantly reduce
               the temperature of the coal sample and extinguish the coal fire
               quickly. The study is useful to develop efficient and

               network becomes compact with trace of Cr2O72− while the lattice
               of crystal also can be destroyed by excessive doping. The UV–Vis

               the doped KDP crystals. Z-scan analysis demonstrates that with
               increasing of Cr2O72− concentration, a gradual raise has been
               observed for the nonlinear absorption coefficient (β). The
               laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) at 532 nm of the KDP
               crystal doped with 3000 ppm Cr2O72− is found to be 28.29 J/cm2
               which is higher than that of pure one under the R-on-1 model.
               However, as the doping concentration continues to increase, the

               Herein we present our findings from operando 7Li NMR measurements
               on a graphite//NMC622 cell. The usual/expected sequencing of
               LixC6 phases from dilute to concentrated observed during charging
               at low (<C/5) rates is replaced at high (≥1C) rates by a direct
               transition to, and propagation of concentrated phases throughout
               the graphite electrode, with no evidence for dilute phases.
               Concurrently, a peak attributed to lithium naphthalenide appears
               at ∼20 ppm. Lithium therefore accumulates on graphite surfaces,
               facilitating Li metal plating under fast charge conditions. While
               some of the deposited Li metal can intercalate into graphite
               after cell charging, a significant fraction accumulates during
               consecutive cycles, creating a barrier for Li+ transport, which
               decreases the amount of recoverable Li, and its intercalation
               rate into graphite. Thus, Li plating not only can create safety
               hazards through dendrite growth, but also irreversibly impairs

               hydrothermal route and investigated their performance for
               hydrogen sensing applications. The structural and morphological
               characterizations were examined by XRD, FESEM, EDS, TEM, and XPS

               nanoparticles on the surface of ZnO flowers. UV-Vis spectroscopy
               and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy were used to investigate
               the optical characteristics. The ZnO and PdO/ZnO sensors were
               explored towards different target gases such as hydrogen (H2),
               carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ethanol. The
               concentration range of target gases was 2–100 ppm at an operating
               temperature range of 200–400 °C. It was concluded that PdO/ZnO
               flowers sensor showed high sensitivity, a speedy response time
               (20 s), and recovery time (960 s) towards H2 at 350 °C in
               comparison to the ZnO sensor. In addition, the PdO decorated ZnO
               flowers-based sensor showed high selectivity towards H2 against
               CO, NO2, and ethanol. This enhanced gas-sensing performance of
               the PdO/ZnO sensor has been attributed to the catalytic effect of

               activation of H2 on Pd surfaces including (1 0 0), (1 1 0) and (1

               lowest dissociative adsorption energy of −0.960 eV and the charge
               transfer of −0.126 e from Pd to H was found on the hexagonal
               close-packed (hcp) site of Pd(1 1 1), suggesting that Pd(1 1 1)
               is most favorable for hydrogen sensing. Consistent with

               The catalyst particles of 0.5\% Ru on γ-Al2O3 pellet supports

               in the field of gas sensing owing to their extraordinary
               electrical, optical and catalytic properties. Their gas sensing
               performance can further be improved by switching from ohmic to
               schottky based sensor due to exponential change of conductance in
               analyte environment. In most of the Schottky based gas sensor,
               the surface of the sensing material is covered by metal electrode
               which reduces the sensing performance. Herein, we have fabricated
               2D SnS2 (thickness: 5.62 ± 1.26 nm) based Schottky junction for
               ammonia detection operated at room temperature using porous
               nickel foil which allows the analyte molecule to maximize the
               interaction with the sensing material. We have compared the
               performance of the Schottky junction sensor with that of SnS2
               based ohmic sensor. The Schottky junction based sensor has 140.7
               times higher response than SnS2 based ohmic sensor at 360 ppm.
               The response of the sensor exhibits exponential behavior with
               ammonia concentration which is explained by estimated barrier
               height modulation from 0.83 eV (in air) to 0.69 eV (at 225 ppm).
               In addition, the long term stability over six months of the
               sensor makes it a promising candidate for practical ammonia

               (RGO)-based nanomaterials have drawn considerable attention in
               the fields of gas monitoring owing to their low operating
               temperature. However, constructing RGO-based room-temperature gas
               sensors possessing ppb-level limit of detection with high
               sensitivity remains challenging. In this work, a series of highly
               sensitive NO2 sensors were fabricated using α-Fe2O3 and SnO2
               co-decorated RGO hybrids (designated as α-Fe2O3/SnO2-RGO) as
               sensing materials. They were rationally synthesized by a one-pot
               hydrothermal method. Compared to SnO2 modified RGO hybrids
               (SnO2-RGO with bandgap of 3.88 eV), the bandgap energy of
               α-Fe2O3/SnO2-RGO hybrids (3.53 eV) was reduced by adding α-Fe2O3;
               the narrower bandgap facilitated the sensing materials to release
               more electrons and form more oxygen ions at room temperature.
               Besides, the high carrier migration of RGO, which served as
               continuous phase, identical structure with ultrasmall particle
               size of α-Fe2O3 and SnO2 (about 3–6 nm), and abundant chemisorbed
               oxygen species on the surface (20.8\%) of the sensing materials,
               as well as their suitable bandgap (3.53 eV) in the sensing
               materials, significantly improved NO2 response at room
               temperature. Among the sensors fabricated,
               α-Fe2O3/SnO2-RGO-15-based NO2 sensor had the highest response of
               7.4 with a short response time of 59 s towards 1 ppm NO2; it
               could even reach a response of 2.6 towards 100 ppb NO2. Notably,
               α-Fe2O3/SnO2-RGO-15 sample has excellent capability to recognize
               NO2, where the response value (7.4) towards 1 ppm NO2 is about 7
               times higher than that of 100 ppm ammonia and common volatile
               organic compounds (formaldehyde, toluene, ethanol and acetone).
               Such NO2 sensor has superior repeatability with negligible
               response deviation towards 1 ppm NO2 for four reversible cycles.
               This makes it to have a great potential application in the field

               prerequisite for zero liquid discharge of saline textile
               wastewater. The development of loose nanofiltration (LNF)
               membranes with customized nanoscale pores and high water
               permeance is expected to address this challenge. Herein, a new
               LNF membrane is reported, fabricated via a scalable interfacial
               polymerization (IP) approach between resveratrol and trimesoyl
               chloride (TMC) on a Kevlar substrate. The optimal resveratrol/TMC
               membrane exhibited an ultra-high pure water permeance (121.1 L−1
               m−2h−1 bar−1), high dye rejection (99.4\% for 200 ppm of Congo
               Red), and low salt rejection (4.2\% for NaCl and 9.8\% for
               Na2SO4). The chemical compositions, surface properties, and
               morphologies of the LNF membranes were characterized to elucidate
               their structure–property-performance relationships. The
               homogeneous diffusion of resveratrol to the water/hexane
               interface and the appropriate stoichiometry of the two monomers
               contribute to the formation of an ultra-thin (35–45 nm) and
               hydrophilic composite membrane, which allows the membrane to
               attain a high water permeance. The LNF membrane additionally
               maintains excellent anti-fouling properties during filtration of
               organic dye solutions, primarily as a result of the high
               hydrophilicity, negative charge density, and smoothness of the
               membrane surface. Importantly, the novel LNF membrane also
               retains stability after washing with ethanol and acetone, owing
               to the cross-linked polyphenol ester and the rigid phenyl
               backbone of the membrane surface. These results reveal the huge
               potential of applying resveratrol-based LNF membranes for the
               treatment of saline textile wastewater. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",

               effective method to improve the SO2 resistance of manganese-based
               catalysts at low temperatures is urgently needed. In this work, a
               hierarchical porous nanowire structure catalyst was designed by
               the in situ self-assembly method to inhibit SO2 adsorption. This
               hierarchical porous nanowire aerogel catalyst with great BET
               surface area and surface acidity exhibited NOx conversion above
               90\% at 100–400 °C. Notably, the NOx conversion of the MnCe-N
               catalyst was almost not inhibited by SO2 (250 ppm) compared to
               the 33\% decrease of the MnCe-P catalyst. On the MnCe-P catalyst,
               SO2 has strong competitive adsorption with NH3 and NO, and the
               stronger adsorption capacity of SO2 inhibits the adsorption
               activation of the reaction gas and hinders the reaction
               proceeding through the L-H mechanism. Meanwhile, a large quantity
               of sulfate is formed on the catalyst surface, which prevents the
               active centre to participate in the redox reaction. The structure
               of nanowires enhances the number of acid sites, facilitates the
               adsorption and activation of NH3, and effectively inhibits the
               adsorption of SO2 on the MnCe-N catalyst. Fewer sulfate species
               are generated and difficult to deposit and aggregate on the
               catalyst surface, as a result, the active centre is less affected
               by sulfate species. The stable adsorption of NH3-related species
               ensures reliable reaction on MnCe-N through the E-R mechanism.

               material by utilizing different metals. CdS was deposited via the

               ITO, and Ag contacts, respectively, through which Schottky
               barrier height (SBH) was adjusted between CdS and metal contact.
               CdS was thoroughly verified by structural and morphological
               characterization techniques. As-fabricated devices were tested,
               and gas sensing results suggest that Au and ITO contacts have

               emulsion separation and removal of hazardous organic pollutants
               is essential to the purification of the complicated wastewater.
               However, it remains a daunting challenge to combine these
               intended functions while maintaining high separation efficiency.
               Herein, we developed a new 2D lamellar MXene/poly (arylene ether
               nitrile) (PEN) fibrous composite membrane through the
               self-assembly of TiO2 nanoparticles intercalated MXene nanosheets
               onto the porous PEN nanofibrous mats and bioinspired polydopamine
               triggered chemical-crosslinking with polyethyleneimine (PEI).
               Such nano-intercalation and mussel-inspired crosslinking could
               effectively regulate the interlayer spacing of the MXene
               nanosheet skin layer and surface wettability of the composite
               membrane, which also further contributed to the fast separation
               and unique bifunctional feature. It was found that the
               MXene@TiO2/PEN fibrous composite membrane exhibited low
               oil-adhesion and superhydrophilic (WCA = 0°)/underwater
               superoleophobic (UOCA > 155°) properties, which could efficiently
               separate various surfactant-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions
               under low pressure of 0.04 MPa while keeping good stability
               (Under 1 M HCl and 2 M NaOH solutions) and recyclability.
               Interestingly, the fibrous composite membrane achieved favorable
               permeation flux of 908–1003 Lm−2h−1 (2270–2507.5 Lm−2h−1bar−1) in
               comparison to other reported MXene based multifunctional
               composite membranes. Moreover, owing to the synergistic effect of
               MXene nanosheets and TiO2 nanoparticles, the MXene@TiO2/PEN
               membrane showed excellent photocatalytic degradation performance
               for various dyes under visible light, i.e. the photocatalytic
               degradation efficiency for 15 ppm MB, MO, CV, and MeB solutions
               achieved 92.31\%, 93.50\%, 98.06\%, and 99.30\% within 60 min,
               respectively. Such 2D MXene bio-functional composite membranes
               with outstanding oil/water emulsions separation and
               photocatalytic degradation of dyes pave an avenue for treating
               complicated oily wastewater. © 2021",

               were also investigated, indicating the values ranged from 1.70 to
               3.66 mmol g−1. The CO2 adsorption capacities fitted well with

               performed by using two kinetic models, and pesudo-second model

               produced by the breakdown of sulfur-containing proteins, is
               highly irritant and toxic. Designing gas sensors sensitive to H2S
               for food spoilage evaluation is of great significance for
               automated quality control in the modern food industry. However,
               humidity in the environment can generally deteriorate the
               detection performance of conventional metal oxide semiconductor
               gas sensors. Therefore, it is critical to develop H2S sensors
               based on novel materials that can operate effectively in
               atmospheric humidity conditions. In this work, tin diselenide
               (SnSe2) nanosheets decorated with tungsten trioxide (WO3)
               nanoparticles are synthesized by a one-step ultrasound strategy,

               molecule activated charge-transfer of the SnSe2/WO3 composite
               boosts H2S sensing ability at high relative humidity (RH) levels.
               At room temperature (25 °C), the SnSe2/WO3 composite sensor with
               optimal mass ratio exhibits enhanced H2S response value

               is proven to be practically effective for evaluating the spoilage
               of eggs by comparing the sensing response of a fresh egg with
               that of a spoiled egg. This study offers possibilities for

               fuel. One main source for DOE's Aluminum-clad spent nuclear fuel
               (ASNF) inventory is the advanced test reactor (ATR) at the INL
               site, which makes this fuel of particular interest for storage
               scenarios. Road-ready and final disposition packaging
               configurations for the ATR fuel dictates storage within
               helium-backfilled, sealed DOE standard canisters. The conditions
               within these sealed canisters for extended (greater than50 year
               dry) storage is of interest. To further this goal, a
               three-dimensional (3D) multi-physics computational fluid dynamics
               (CFD) model is developed of the sealed DOE standard canisters.
               This 3D CFD model is one-way coupled with bulk gas radiolysis
               reactions considering sealed canisters with inert gas and
               possible trace amounts of air and water vapor. This study looks
               at the evolution of the thermal history of the canisters over a
               50 year time period with a coupling to the chemical reactions
               occurring from radiolytic breakdown of residual water. A
               sensitivity study is then carried out over the parameters of the
               model including the fuel decay heat, residual water content,
               sealed pressure, canister external temperature, and canister
               emissivity. In pure helium, hydrogen generation rates are low,
               under 10 ppm, but hydrogen generation rates are affected greatly
               by the presence of even 1\% residual air, increasing by
               50-plus-fold, and nitric acid generation with residual air also
               occurs ranging from 500 to 4000 ppm after 50 years. The fuel
               decay heat and the residual water content show the most
               importance in the generation of hydrogen gas in pure air, and for
               nitric acid with a residual air condition. External temperature,
               canister emissivity and sealed pressure all show minor

               impurities to low-sulfur biofuel, and this production process

               composite catalysts (10 wt\% base catalyst and 1 wt\% cupric

               94\% over Cu(NO3)3 and K2CO3 (1 wt\%:10 wt\%). The copper nitrate
               catalyst converted sulfur species into water and H2S. In
               addition, to further obtain high-quality biofuel with low cold
               flow property, the above generated biofuel with low sulfur
               content was hydro-isomerized over the Ce–Pt/SAPO-11 catalyst.
               Under the action of the bimetallic catalyst, the isomerization
               reaction could be carried out at low reaction temperature (300

               ammonia/aliphatic amines over aromatic amines has been
               investigated by means of a novel “opto-electronic nose”, CN-2,
               synthesized in a single-step via multiple inter/intramolecular
               C-N fusion reactions. The in-situ generated mono-protonated CN-2
               can selectively detect primary to secondary to even tertiary
               aliphatic amines over aromatic amines within ∼40 S with extremely
               low detection threshold values of 27.2 ppb, 0.7 ppm, 5.4 ppm, 1.7
               ppm from UV–Vis and 42.5 ppb, 1.61 ppm, 5.5 ppm, 6.14 ppm from
               fluorescence spectral data for NH3, hydrazine (primary amine),
               diethanolamine (secondary amine) and triethylamine (tertiary
               amine) respectively with the hypsochromic shift in the UV–Vis
               spectra along with fluorescence attenuation via target-specific
               deprotonation. The colorimetric signal can also be examined by
               Smartphone APP, which is well correlated with spectrophotometric
               outcomes. Interestingly, due to presence of a unique protonated
               antenna centre CN-2 with anti-oxidant activity can also detect
               aliphatic biogenic amines, like putrescine, spermidine, which are
               frequently released from spoiled food. Therefore, it may be
               exploited as smart food-spoilage indicator in real-time. Again,
               the aliphatic biogenic amines recognition capability from human
               urine made it as a potential prostate cancer biomarker sensor for
               clinical use, which alleviates the need of biopsies. CN-2 could
               also be employed towards one-to-two decoder logic-circuitry
               formulation to monitor the ammonia levels. Moreover,
               CN-2-functionalized hydrogel-membrane based portable, handy
               prototype could be utilized for easy on-site recognition of amine
               vapour. Reversible sensing behaviour in presence of HCl enables
               CN-2 to exhibit anti-counterfeiting activity. To the best of our
               knowledge, this is the first all-in-one phenazine-based
               Smartphone-assisted chromo-fluorogenic-chemosensor, which would
               be of enormous interest in food-packaging industry, information

               basalts (MORBs and OIBs) preserve unique information about early
               Earth processes and the long-term volatile cycles between Earth's
               mantle and the surface. Icelandic basalts present ideal material
               to examine the oldest known terrestrial mantle reservoir,
               accessed through a deep-rooted mantle plume, but their multiple
               sulfur isotope systematics have not been explored previously.
               Here, we present new sulfur concentration (30–1570 ppm) and
               isotope data (δ34S = −2.5 to +3.8‰ and Δ33S = −0.045 to +0.016‰;
               vs. Canyon Diablo Troilite) from a sample suite (n = 62) focused
               on subglacially erupted basaltic glasses obtained from Iceland's
               neovolcanic zones. Using these data along with trace element
               systematics to account for the effects of magmatic processes
               (degassing and immiscible sulfide melt formation) on δ34S, we
               show that primitive (MgO > 6 wt.\%), least degassed glasses
               accurately record the δ34S signatures of their mantle sources.
               Compared to the depleted MORB source mantle (DMM; δ34S =
               −1.3±0.3‰), the Iceland mantle is shown to have a greater range
               of δ34S values between −2.5 and −0.1\%. Similarly, Icelandic
               basalts are characterized by more variable and negatively shifted
               Δ33S values (−0.035 to +0.013‰) relative to DMM (0.004±006‰).
               Negative δ34S-Δ33S signatures are most prominent in basalts from
               the Snæfellsnes Volcanic Zone and the Kverkfjöll volcanic system,
               which also have the lowest, most MORB-like 3He/4He (8–9 R/RA,
               where RA is the 3He/4He of air) and the highest Ba/La (up to 12)
               in Iceland. We propose that subduction fluid-enriched, mantle
               wedge type material, possibly present in the North Atlantic upper
               mantle, constitutes a low-δ34S-Δ33S component in the Icelandic
               mantle. This suggests that volatile heterogeneity in Iceland, and
               potentially at other OIBs, may originate not only from diverse
               plume-associated mantle components, but also from a heterogeneous
               ambient upper mantle. By contrast, a set of samples with high
               3He/4He (up to 25.9 R/RA) and negative μ182W anomalies define an
               ancient lower mantle reservoir with a near-chondritic Δ33S and
               δ34S signature of ∼0‰. The difference between DMM and the high
               high-3He/4He mantle may reflect separate conditions during
               core-mantle differentiation, or a previously unidentified flux of
               sulfur from the core to the high-3He/4He reservoir. © 2022

               plume that exhibits an extreme Enriched Mantle-1 signature. The
               origin of this peculiar mantle endmember remains contentious, and
               could involve the recycling of marine sediments of Archean or
               Proterozoic ages, delaminated units from the lower continental
               crust, or metasomatized peridotites from a lithospheric mantle.
               Here, we report the sulfur multi-isotopic signature (32S, 33S,
               34S, 36S) of 15 fresh submarine basaltic glasses from three
               Pitcairn seamounts. We observe evidence for magmatic degassing of
               sulfur from melts erupted ∼2,000 meters below seawater level
               (mbsl). Sulfur concentrations are correlated with eruption depth,
               and range between 1300 ppm S (collected ∼ 2,500 mbsl) and 600 ppm
               S (∼2,000 mbsl). The δ34S values can be accounted for under
               equilibrium isotope fractionation during degassing, with
               αgas-melt between 1.0020 and 1.0001 and starting δ34S values
               between −0.9‰ and +0.6‰. The δ34S estimates are similar or higher
               than MORB signatures, suggesting the contribution of recycled
               sulfur with a ∼ 1‰ 34S enrichment compared to the Pacific upper
               mantle. The Δ33S and Δ36S signatures average at +0.024±0.007‰ and
               +0.02±0.07‰ vs. CDT, respectively (all 1σ). Only Δ33S is
               statistically different from MORB, by +0.02‰. The Δ33S enrichment
               is invariant across degassing and sulfide segregation. We suggest
               it reflects a mantle source enrichment rather than a
               high-temperature fractionation of S in the basalts. Despite the
               small magnitude of the 33S-36S variations, our data require a
               substantial amount of recycled sulfur overwhelm the Pitcairn
               mantle source. We show that models involving metasomatized
               peridotites, lower crust units, or Archean sediments, may be
               viable, but are restricted to narrow sets of circumstances.
               Instead, scenarios involving the contribution of Proterozoic
               marine sediments appear to be the most parsimonious explanation

               homocysteine probe (NPO-Pyr) based on pyridine-thiol coordination
               and amine-addition. To date, Hcy has been recognized as an
               excellent biomarker for various diseases, but there still remain
               some limitations in detecting of Hcy due to its structural
               similarity to Cys. In this study, we developed a new fluorescent
               diagnostic probe for monitoring Hcy by incorporating
               4-hydroxy-pyridine moiety into the skeleton of the NBD
               fluorophore. The incorporated pyridine moiety could coordinate
               with the thiol group at Hcy, followed by the amine-addition

               sensitivity (LOD: 0.084 ppm), and a fast-response time (<5 min).
               Furthermore, NPO-Pyr could predict the formation of glioblastoma

               SWCNTs-HFIPPH based sensor exhibits remarkably higher response to
               DMMP than bare SWCNT based gas sensor within only few seconds.
               The gas sensing response of SWCNTs-HFIPPH based sensor for 1 ppm
               DMMP is 18.2\%, and the response time is about 10 s. What's more,
               the gas sensor we proposed here shows excellent selectivity and

               Investigation on the microstructural evolution in the

               treatment, the alloy splits into a primary α phase and a β phase.

               storage time for the modified resin has exceeded 90 days, and a
               low free formaldehyde content (0.05 ppm). Furthermore, the
               as-prepared foam exhibited excellent flame retardancy properties

               effective, reducing, and stabilizing agent-free strategies are
               highly required for biomedical applications. Within this context,
               we report the employment of silver nanostructure decorated TiO2
               nanowires (TiO2 NWs) as an ideal antibacterial agent against
               antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and
               Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus). Firstly, TiO2 NWs
               were fabricated via the hydrothermal procedure. Afterward, by
               utilizing the oxidative polymerization of
               3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (L-DOPA), a conformal and thin
               polymer layer of L-DOPA (PLDP) was created onto the TiO2 NWs
               (TiO2/PLDP). Lastly, Ag nanostructures were deposited onto the
               TiO2/PLDP (TiO2/PLDP/Ag NP) via simply reduction of silver ions.
               Herein, PLDP with its abundant catechol and amine groups played
               an important role in the reduction of silver ions and the
               adsorption of Ag nanostructures with high affinity and resultant
               stability. The size, density, and morphology of Ag nanostructures
               were manipulated by tuning the initial amount of Ag ions in a
               well-controlled manner. The resultant colloidal TiO2/PLDP/Ag
               composite nanosystem provided remarkably high and stable
               antibacterial activity against both antibiotic-resistant bacteria
               strains. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values were found
               to be 125, 250, and > 500 ppm for high, medium and, low
               deposition of Ag nanostructures, respectively. Similarly, Minimum
               Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) for these NP systems, MBC values
               were found to be 250, 500, and > 1000 ppm, respectively. Also,
               relatively lower cytotoxicity in human lung healthy (MRC5) and
               cancer (A549) cell lines was detected in a dose-dependent manner

               biofilm and the presence of biosurfactants generated by
               microorganisms in the reservoir, can play a role in reducing
               interfacial tension (IFT) and wettability alteration. In this
               work, the fluid-fluid interaction by measuring the IFT has been
               evaluated for combining two EOR methods, including low salinity
               water and MEOR, due to the high importance of fluid-fluid
               interaction in EOR. GeoBacillus stearothermophilus has been used
               as a bacterium to study changes in IFT. The effect of different
               salts, including monovalent and divalent cations and anions at
               different salinities, on biosurfactant performance, is
               investigated using IFT measurements. Also, the type of oil is
               evaluated in terms of its acidic and basic properties on the
               performance of biosurfactants. According to the results of this
               study, injection of GeoBacillus stearothermophilus bacteria
               reduces interfacial tension in acidic oil by 10.26\% and in basic
               oil by 5.26\%. According to the results, increasing salinity in
               the presence of oil-containing asphaltene with basic properties
               increases the IFT of the solution containing GeoBacillus
               stearothermophilus bacteria, but in the presence of acidic oil, a
               decrease in IFT is observed. The most significant effect of
               reducing the IFT of acidic oil and solution containing
               GeoBacillus stearothermophilus is obtained in the presence of the
               following salts, respectively: CaCl2 > MgCl2 > NaCl. The results
               show that with increasing CaCl2 concentration, the IFT between
               basic oil and GeoBacillus stearothermophilus solution gradually
               increases. This ascending trend is in the presence of NaCl salt
               with a lower slope. However, in the presence of MgCl2 salt, dual
               behavior is observed before and after the concentration of 1000
               ppm, so that before this concentration, the IFT increases and
               then decreases. The findings of this study can help for a better
               understanding of the interaction of bacteria with asphaltenic
               oils in the presence of effective salts for low salinity water
               injection. The results of this study showed that by combining low
               salinity water with bacteria, less IFT could be obtained than low
               salinity water or bacteria alone. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",

               semiconductors in the history of material science research,
               because of its innumerable benefits in all dimensional
               nanostructures. However, no endeavor has been dedicated as of now
               to understanding the size-dependent tuning of nonradiative
               emission efficiency and how it influences the sensitive detection
               of organic vapors (ethanol and acetone) through photoluminescence
               (PL) quenching mechanism. Herein, the aspect ratio of CdTe
               nanorods (NRs) is varied by changing its diameter while keeping
               the axial length constant through electrodeposition into lab made
               anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) membranes. The growth kinetics and
               thermodynamics involved while electrodeposition of CdTe NR in
               each distinct pore diameter of AAO membrane is studied and
               reasoned. The surface morphology of variable diameter AAO
               membranes and NRs, respectively fabricated under various
               electrochemical parameters are observed through a field emission
               scanning electron microscope. The relation between NRs dimension
               and structural parameters like d-spacing, crystallite size, band
               area ratio, and exciton-phonon ratio are extracted from X-ray
               diffraction and Resonance Raman spectroscopy. The strongly
               luminescent CdTe NRs, coupled with their chemical durability and
               organic molecule affinity displayed a sensitive response of ~12
               and 6 ppm to ethanol and acetone vapors in the range of 10–100
               ppm as a PL sensor. The carrier lifetime measurement through
               time-correlated single photon counting spectroscopy endorses the
               role of increased recombination density with a decrease in the

               using a precursor solution containing chloride ions. Following
               calcination, the crystallinity of the rutile phases in the TiO2
               layer was enhanced. In the CV profiles (obtained over a potential
               range between −0.6 and −1.2 V (versus Ag/AgCl, 3 M KCl) in a 100
               ppm 2,4,6-TNT solution under ambient conditions), the three main
               reduction peaks of 2,4,6-TNT were observed only for the calcined
               TiO2 layer owing to the increased crystallinity of the rutile

               facilitated high active site density, a large electrochemically
               active surface area, and short electrochemical reaction times
               under low charge transfer resistance, which were key for
               enhancing the performance of the rutile TiO2 layer as the

               36.0 ppm, respectively, with a linear range of 10–100 ppm, for
               2,4,6-TNT detection using the calcined TiO2 layer as the working

               consider effect modifications of mercury (Hg) and selenium (Se).
               Objectives: To examine the joint association of prenatal
               LCn3PUFAs, Hg and Se with infant cognitive performance, and to
               explore whether DNA methylation may explain this potential
               association. Methods: A total of 484 newborns were enrolled from
               the Shanghai Birth Cohort with available data on cord blood
               LCn3PUFA, nail Hg and Se during 2015–2016. Cord blood LCn3PUFA
               concentrations were assessed by gas chromatography, and nail Hg
               and Se concentrations were measured using clippings collected
               within 6 months of birth by inductively coupled plasma mass
               spectrometry. Five aspects of infant neurodevelopment
               (communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem-solving, and
               personal-social skills) were assessed using the Age and Stage
               Questionnaire (ASQ) at ages 6 and 12 months.
               Multivariable-adjusted generalized estimating equations models
               were performed to examine the associations between cord blood
               LCn3PUFA concentrations and ASQ test scores, and these
               associations were stratified by nail Hg and Se levels.
               Epigenome-wide DNA methylation in cord blood was compared in a
               random subgroup consisting of 19 infants from the highest and 21
               from the lowest decile of LCn3PUFA concentrations. Results:
               LCn3PUFAs were not significantly associated with any ASQ test
               scores. However, in the subgroup with lower Hg (<median 0.13 ppm)
               and higher Se (≥median 0.87 ppm) levels, infants with higher
               LCn3PUFA concentrations had higher ASQ scores indicating better
               performance in gross motor skills [quartile 4 vs. 1: mean
               difference = 7.78; 95\% confidence interval=(3.47, 12.09);

               concentrations with infant neurodevelopment, particularly gross
               motor skills, may be observed among infants with high Se and low

               and provide hope of clean energy in the future, photon energy has
               particle characteristics, and there is an inevitable connection
               between the wave behavior and the particle behavior of light,
               in-depth understanding and exploration are required. Based on the
               hypothesis of the strong interaction between electrons and
               protons to generate photons, the energy and behaviors of photons
               are discussed herein. By analyzing and calculating the photon
               speed, the negative photon speed was found to be in excellent
               agreement with the existing light speed constant. The Compton
               effect wavelength shift was analyzed and deduced considering the
               interaction of positive photons and atoms, and new conclusions
               are drawn, proposing the reason why X-rays are positive photons.
               Based on existing data, the observed estimation value of the
               negative photon velocity shift is 0.0295 ppm. From the
               interaction of the spin-charged particles, the relationship
               between the photon wavelength and its magnetic moment was
               calculated. In addition, we analyzed and calculated the
               characteristics of photon orbits, inferred the mechanism of
               atomic luminescence, and qualitatively explained the phenomenon
               of blackbody radiation. Based on the effect of charged spin
               photons and the electromagnetic potential field, we explain the
               reason for the simultaneous existence of reflection and
               refraction. The relationship between the incident angle and the
               reflectivity was analyzed, and refractive index formulas were
               derived to reasonably explain the characteristics of the X-ray
               refractive index. As a result, edge diffraction is considered a
               special case of refraction. By analyzing the fluctuation of the
               potential field inside the atom, the diffraction phenomenon of
               charged particles is described, and a particle explanation of the
               phenomenon of light waves and beat frequencies interference is
               provided. It is believed that the physical model of photon
               charging conforms to the existing physical laws. Photon energy is

               catalyst properties and operating conditions, it is possible to
               direct the product distribution to obtain oils that may be
               suitable both as fuels and as chemicals. However, the efficient
               and safe removal of the halogens, often contained in plastic
               wastes, remains as a great challenge. In this work, the catalytic
               behaviour of ZSM-5 zeolites in the pyrolysis of a real
               chlorinated plastic waste of the electric and electronic
               equipment sector (WEEE), consisting of PE with about 3.4\% of
               PVC, was investigated. To that end, three zeolite samples with
               different acidity and accessibility were synthesized and assayed.
               A thermal pre-treatment was applied to the plastic waste at 350
               ºC, which allowed a chlorine removal of 87\% from the WEEE
               feedstock. The pyrolysis tests were carried out in a downdraft
               fixed-bed stainless steel reactor, with a catalyst/feedstock
               ratio of 0.2, at temperatures of 600 ºC and 450 ºC in the thermal
               and catalytic zones, respectively, of the reaction system. In
               comparison with thermal pyrolysis, that mainly produced waxes,
               the product distribution changed considerably by contacting the
               pyrolysis vapours with ZSM-5 zeolites, leading to a strong
               enhancement in the yield of oil and gases. The largest yield of
               oil (about 60 wt\%), having a concentration of monoaromatics
               (mainly BTX) above 50 wt\%, was attained over the desilicated
               ZSM-5 sample. Regarding chlorine distribution, about 90\% was
               accumulated in the char fraction, probably captured by the

               localized 1H MRS sequences at 3T, using the entire spin system of
               N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) as an example of the large chemical
               shift spread of all the metabolites routinely detected in vivo,
               including the amide region. We specifically focus on the design
               of the suitable broadband excitation radiofrequency (RF) pulses
               to minimize chemical shift artifacts. Methods: The performance of
               the excitation and refocusing pulse shapes is evaluated with
               respect to NAA localization. Two new excitation RF pulses are
               developed to achieve optimized performance in the brain using
               single-voxel 1H MRS at 3T. Numerical simulations and in vivo
               experiments are carried out to demonstrate the performance of the
               RF pulses. Results: New excitation RF pulses with the same B1
               requirements but larger excitation bandwidth (up to a factor of
               2) are shown to significantly reduce localization artifacts. The
               large frequency spread of the entire NAA spin system necessitates
               the use of broadband excitation and refocusing pulses for MRS at
               3T. Conclusion: To minimize chemical shift artifacts of metabolic
               compounds with spins in the amide area (>5 ppm) at 3T it is
               important to use broadband excitation and refocusing pulses. ©

               researchers turning their attention to theoretical studies for
               more reasonable molecular structure as the appeal of energy
               conservation and green chemistry. Corroles, oxacorroles (OC) and

               systematically explore their structures, intramolecular hydrogen

               influenced by the inner O atoms positions with density functional
               theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory
               (TDDFT). The smaller NICS(1)ZZ values of oxacorrole (−35.23 ppm
               to −33.54 ppm) and dioxacorrole (−34.91 ppm to −33.24) than these
               of corroles (−32.97 ppm and −33.12 ppm) indicate that the O atoms
               attendances can increase the molecular aromaticity. The gradually
               increasing energy gaps of H-8 to H-3 from Corrole1 and Corrole2
               to DOC series and the larger charge of CO (+0.208e—+0.380e) than

               considered as the effective cold flow improvers (CFIs) for
               diesel. To investigate the structure–activity relationship and
               obtain more high-efficiency CFIs, a series of
               methacrylate-methacrylamide copolymers with various pendants
               (C14MC-BnMAM, C14MC-DpMAM, and C14MC-TrMAM) were synthesized by
               the radical polymerization of tetradecyl methacrylate (C14MC)
               with N-benzylmethacrylamide (BnMAM),
               N-(diphenylmethyl)methacrylamide (DpMAM) and N-(triphenylmethyl)
               methacrylamide (TrMAM) at various molar ratios. The depressive
               effects of these CFIs with different benzene ring number on the
               diesel were tested by cold flow properties. Results illustrated
               that the overall depressive effects of this three copolymers
               decrease with increase of the benzene rings number in the
               side-chain, and the order is as follows: C14MC-BnMAM >
               C14MC-DpMAM > C14MC-TrMAM As the monomer molar ratio up to 6:1,
               these CFIs exhibited the largest reduction on the solid point

               insect pests whose distribution is mainly constrained by low
               temperatures. This is the case of the pine processionary moth
               (Thaumetopoea pityocampa), which is one of the main conifer
               defoliators in the Mediterranean Basin. Warmer winters may lead
               to a northward/upward expansion of this insect, as short-term
               studies have shown. However, no long-term data, i.e. spanning at
               least one century, has been used to examine these projections. We
               test the hypotheses that climatic warming (i) has caused an
               upward shift of the pine processionary moth, and (ii) has
               increased the frequency of severe defoliations. We used
               dendrochronological methods to reconstruct defoliations over the
               period 1900–2006 in 14 sites spanning a wide altitudinal range
               (1070–1675 m) in Teruel, eastern Spain. We built local ring-width
               chronologies for four co-occurring pine species with different
               degree of susceptibility against the moth defoliations, from
               highly suitable or palatable species (Pinus nigra) to moderately
               (Pinus sylvestris, Pinus halepensis) or rarely defoliated species
               (Pinus pinaster). We validated the tree-ring reconstructions of
               outbreaks using a field record of stand defoliations spanning the
               period 1971–2006. Outbreaks in the most affected P. nigra stands
               corresponded to abrupt one- to two-year growth reductions
               (70–90\% growth loss). Reconstructed outbreaks occurred on
               average every 9–14 years. The growth memory of outbreaks was
               weaker but lasted longer (1–6 years) than that due to droughts
               (1–3 years). Neither an upward expansion nor an increase in
               outbreak frequency was observed. Severe PPM defoliations did not
               increase as climate warmed, rather they were positively related

               terrestrial biosphere, seasonal weather patterns and
               anthropogenic emissions. Hence, to understand the variability in
               regional surface GHG fluxes, high precision GHGs measurements
               were initiated by the National Remote Sensing Center (NRSC) of
               India. We report continuous CO2 and CH4measurements during 2014
               to 2017 for the first time from Shadnagar, a suburban site in
               India. Annual mean CO2 and CH4 concentrations are 399.56 ± 5.46
               ppm and 1.929 ± 0.09 ppm, respectively, for 2017. After the
               strong El Niño of 2015–2016, an abnormal rise in CO2 growth rate
               of 5.5 ppm year−1 was observed in 2017 at the study site,
               compared to 3.03 ppm year−1 at Mauna Loa. Thus, the repercussion
               of the El Niño effect diminishes the net uptake by the
               terrestrial biosphere accompanied by increased soil respiration.
               Seasonal tracer to tracer correlation between CO2 and CH4 was
               also analyzed to characterize the possible source-sink
               relationship between the species. We compared CO2 and CH4
               concentrations to simulations from an atmospheric chemistry
               transport model (ACTM). The seasonal phases of CH4 were well
               captured by the ACTM, whereas the seasonal cycle amplitude of CO2

               working with flammable gases. This article describes the

               using the Solution Blow Spinning (SBS) method for

               influence of element doping and the chemical
               composition/elemental states were studied by X-ray diffraction
               (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
               (XPS). The 5 at\% Al–SnO2/15 at\% F–SnO2 composite-based sensor
               exhibited high sensitivity to ethanol (R = 3.0 at 100 ppm) at
               room temperature. This sensor also showed short response/recovery
               times, excellent selectivity, repeatability and long-term

               various physiological processes. However, the accumulation of
               excessive Fe affects plant growth and agricultural productivity.
               In the present study, 250 iron tolerant bacteria (ITB) were
               isolated from 25 soil samples, screened for plant
               growth-promoting properties and identified based on 16S rRNA gene
               sequencing. A pot study experiment using rice plants amended with
               three forms of Fe (FeSO4, FeCl3 and [Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2]) revealed
               the enhancement of root and shoot length ranged from
               42.67\%–177.35\% and 88.10\%–119.19\% in FeSO4 amended soil,
               64.25\%–161.54\% and 81.07\%–124.46\% in FeCl3 soil and
               66.65\%–159.60\% and 69.04\%–119.70\% in Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 compared
               to control and non-inoculated plants. Further, the ITB inoculated
               seedling showed enhanced N uptake 0-4 fold and P content 1-2 fold
               compared to control. Similar enhancement of Fe mobilization was
               also observed for soils amended with FeSO4 (2-4 fold in the root
               and 2-3.5 in the shoot), FeCl3 (2.5-6 and 2-5 fold) and
               Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 (2-5 and 0-2 fold). The estimation of and Fe2＋ and
               Fe3＋ revealed that Fe2+ uptake in the ITB inoculated roots and
               shoots of rice plant ranged to 4-7.85 ppm compared to control
               (0.55-18.36 ppm). Whereas the Fe3＋ uptake was ranged to
               20.52-58.15 ppm in roots and 0.70-47.61 ppm in shoots compared to
               control (0.67-1.95 and 0.25-3.12 ppm). Enhanced chlorophyll

               the variation of the particle properties as a function of
               deposition radius. Two different TTIP loadings (280 and 560 ppm)
               were studied in two flames: a lean flame (equivalence ratio,
               ϕ=0.35) and a stoichiometric flame (ϕ=1.0). First, the growth of
               particles was described using a spherical particle model that was
               fully coupled to the conservation equations of chemically
               reacting flow and solved in 2D using the finite volume method.
               Second, particle trajectories were extracted from the 2D
               simulations and post-processed using a hybrid
               particle-number/detailed particle model solved using a stochastic
               numerical method. In the 2D simulations, the particles were
               predicted to have mean diameters in the range 3–10 nm, which is
               consistent with, but slightly less than experimental values
               observed in the literature. Off-centreline particle trajectories
               experienced longer residence times at higher temperatures
               downstream of the flame front. Two particle size distribution
               (PSD) shapes were observed. In the lean flame, a bimodal PSD was
               observed due to the high rates of inception and surface growth.
               In contrast, the stoichiometric flame was dominated by
               coagulation and the particles quickly attained a self-preserving
               size distribution. The PSDs were found to be different beyond a
               deposition radius of approximately one and a half times the
               nozzle radius due to a small degree of aggregation; this may
               impact the synthesis of nanoparticles using jet-wall stagnation
               flames for novel applications. Suggestions are made for future
               work, not least including the need for the predicted radial

               dry-air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) over the Indian region using
               remote sensing satellite measurements is of interest due to the
               sparseness of ground-based observations. In this study, we
               utilized OCO-2 satellite retrievals in conjunction with an
               atmospheric chemistry-transport model (ACTM) simulations for a
               set of known (bottom-up) and optimized (top-down) flux for the
               period September 2014 to December 2018. Results showed the
               highest XCO2 during the pre-monsoon season, due to prevailing
               seasonal-high temperatures and drier soil conditions that
               resulted in increased respiration and suppressed photosynthesis.
               In contrast, a reduction in XCO2 during the monsoon season is
               found as precipitation increased soil moisture and moderated the
               air temperature, driving vegetation growth by which
               photosynthesis exceeded respiration by the land biosphere. Model
               - observation differences of XCO2 have shown the overestimation
               (underestimation) during monsoon (pre-monsoon) especially over
               the central India region, which might be due to underestimation
               of the modeled peak-to-trough biospheric fluxes. Analyses of the
               latitudinal distribution of XCO2 averaged over Indian landmass
               shows a clear increasing trend and seasonality. An enormous
               increase in XCO2 of about ~12 ppm during 2015–2018 is estimated
               from OCO-2, which is in good agreement with model-simulated XCO2
               (optimized flux case) and consistent with the global growth rate
               from surface observations. The time series and seasonal cycle of
               XCO2 have also been examined using model simulations over
               different parts of the Indian region and agreed well with those
               from OCO-2. Over the northern regions, especially over the Indo
               Gangetic Plain, the peak-to-trough seasonal cycle amplitudes of
               2–3 ppm are twice than those in the southern and oceanic
               regions,~1–1.5 ppm. An annual total CO2 flux of −397 ± 99 TgC/yr
               is estimated by the inversion and that is consistent with the

               thermal stability and pore structure of the produced activated
               carbon materials were characterized. The results revealed that
               the activation process substantially increases the specific

               mesopores (0.01–0.85 cm3g-1) within average nano size range of
               50–100 nm. This study provides an effective means to remove the
               thymol blue dye via adsorption over activated carbon (ACs) as
               adsorbent. Batch adsorption of thymol blue was conducted to
               verify the effect of variety of pH, dye concentrations, contact
               time, adsorbent dose and temperature. The highest dye removal
               efficiency (approximately 98.05\%) of ACs generated from waste
               plastic polybags, cups and bottles was observed at 10 ppm of
               thymol blue dye. The results also exhibited that the dye
               adsorption was favourable at basic pH (9.0) and increasing amount
               of adsorbent dosage promotes the dye removal efficiency. The
               excellent dye removal performance was primarily due to the
               presence of higher available surface area on the surface of
               developed carbon fibres. In addition, the current results have
               given the large overview and useful information of dye removal

               explored the physical, spontaneous and endothermic adsorption
               process. The as prepared ACs provided easy regeneration of
               adsorbents with fast response which further suggests the
               efficiency of nanoparticles to promote their usage up to 5
               consecutive cycles. The current work illustrated that better

               arsenite-induced changes in glucose metabolism in mice have not
               been fully investigated. In the present study, F0 pregnant mice
               were exposed to arsenite via drinking water (0, 0.5, 5, or 50 ppm
               NaAsO2) from gestational day 0 (GD0) until parturition. We
               examined the effects of arsenite exposure on the metabolic
               phenotypes and the levels of proteins and genes related to
               glucose metabolism of dams and their offspring (F1∼F4). Arsenite
               exposure altered the glucose tolerance of offspring. Notably,

               threatening millions of people worldwide. Calcite is considered
               an ideal adsorbent for defluoridation owing to its widespread
               presence and low cost. To further enhance its performance, we
               synthesize a series of phosphate-modified calcites with varying
               phosphate concentrations. The surface modification led to the
               formation of a nanosized hydroxyapatite (HAP) coating on the
               calcite surface. With increasing concentrations of phosphate used
               for modification, the BET specific surface area of the adsorbents
               was dramatically enhanced, resulting in a great enhancement of F
               uptake. At low F concentrations (i.e., 2 mM), surface
               modification did not enhance F uptake by calcite. The 19F
               solid-state MAS NMR analysis revealed that the predominant
               deflurodation mechanism is the formation of CaF2 precipitates
               (δ(19F) = −108 ppm) for both pristine and modified calcite at
               high F concentrations. Under this condition, the contribution of

               violet (CV) dye from the synthetic wastewater. Adsorption
               experiments were performed in batch mode, and various operational
               parameters like initial dye concentration, adsorbent dosage,
               solution pH, and contact time were studied to optimize the

               influenced by pH and initial dye concentration of the wastewater.
               The maximum adsorption was recorded at a pH of 5 and a dye
               concentration of 200 ppm, considered optimal operational
               conditions. Different isotherm models such as Langmuir,
               Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinnin–Radushkevich were used for
               adsorption equilibrium study at various temperatures. The
               monolayer adsorption mechanism was confirmed by fitting the
               obtained adsorption data to the Langmuir isotherm model, and the
               highest adsorption capacity of around 454.54 mg/g was obtained.

               kinetic models like pseudo first order, second order, and
               intra–particle diffusion types indicate that the adsorption of CV
               on CHP surface follows suitably the pseudo second order kinetic
               model. Various thermodynamic parameters, e.g., standard entropy
               (ΔS°), Gibbs free energy (ΔG°), and enthalpy (ΔH°) were also
               experimentally evaluated which proved to be an endothermic and

               of the adsorbent was explained and a regeneration method for
               repetitive use was studied. It can be concluded that CHP could be
               a cost–effective and locally available potential adsorbent to

               ppm was investigated. The treated plants showed increased As

               and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. In the pot experiment, the
               parameters studied have shown that the integrated treatments of
               ZnO-NPs and BF cause a notable enhancement in relative water
               content 43\%–50\% and plant biomass. Moreover, the same treatment

               could be a very effective bio source for improving maize plant
               growth under As stress. In in silico study, As mediated network
               of proteins showed positive and negative regulation of As

               probe for trace detection of the phytohormone ethylene based on
               the mechanism of the olefin metathesis reaction. The probe was
               prepared by simply incubating the ruthenium-based complex (FPRu)
               with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Then the structure of the probe
               was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
               (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and
               circular dichroism circular dichroism (CD). The probe possesses a
               satisfactory detection of limit (LOD) for ethylene (1.17 ppm) and
               a decent linear range (4–250 ppm). Moreover, the probe-based test

               completing the visualization effect. Ethylene concentration
               monitoring at plant maturity could be done in solution and vapor.
               In particular, due to the protection of the hydrophobic pocket of

               emerges as promising fuel however due to some demerits the
               minimum engine emissions and better combustion can be achieved in
               CRDI engines through employing a split injection strategy. Within
               this context, the primary goal of this research is to development
               of optimum injector control maps using a novel global model-based
               scheme for an entire operating range of engines fuelled with
               Eucalyptus blended diesel (80:20 vol). The empirical relation
               between engine explanatory and response variables are models
               through the response surface methodology (RSM) based on the
               I-optimal design technique. For the developed map through the
               model and multivariate optimization, the efficiency achieved the
               best value of 33.74\% whereas fuel consumption is 0.375 kg/kWh.
               The maximum emission rate of hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, oxides

               efficiency of 15.63\% and a decrease in fuel consumption of
               5.12\% is achieved for the Eucalyptus blend. NOX and smoke

               highly reactive for the adsorption of oxygen species that led to
               significant improvement in gas sensing performance. In this work,
               we report on the room temperature (RT) NO2 gas sensing
               performances of hybrid nanocomposites with the interpenetrated
               network using p-Phenylenediamine-reduced graphene oxide (PrGO)
               decorated TiO2 NPs. The fabricated TiO2 NPs/PrGO heterostructure
               sensor demonstrated the superior NO2 response (∼14.9\% to 100 ppm
               of NO2) compared to TiO2/rGO and pristine TiO2 nanoplates. On the
               other hand, the TiO2 NPs/PrGO heterostructure device showed high
               sensitivity, repeatability and excellent selectivity with short
               response/recovery times towards NO2 gas at RT. Further, the
               performances of the TiO2NPs/PrGO gas sensor was accelerated by UV
               irradiation (λ = 365 nm), and the response was found as ~35.68\%
               to 100 ppm of NO2 at RT, which was ~2.35-fold times higher than
               the dark condition. The high gas sensing performance would be
               attributed to the electrical sensitization of PrGO and the ample
               interface between TiO2 NPs and PrGO that stimulated the charge
               separation with faster charge transport characteristics. Our
               strategy and results shed new light to exploit diverse

               piezo-sensors with nanostructured modifiers of electrodes was
               utilized for the detection of highly volatile biomolecules
               (amines, ketones, alcohols, aldehydes, carbonic acids) in
               cervical mucus samples directly in a consulting room. We were
               solving the task to develop a model for rapid identification of
               patients with gynecologic inflammation diseases according to
               results from gaseous sensors or a single sensor scanning of a
               mixture composition of volatile molecules released by mucus.
               Whereupon we propose the following group ranking as
               ``conditionally healthy'', ``remission'', and
               ``inflammation/infection''. Preliminary, by individual substances
               we estimated selectivity and kinetic features of
               sorption-desorption processes on the selected array of stabilized
               gaseous sensors. According to the groups of compounds the
               detection limit by an array of sensors is 20 ррm for ketones by
               acetone, 10 ppm for alcohols by ethanol, for arenas 2 ppm by
               toluene, 20 ppb by ammonia and for amines 5 ppb by diethylamine.
               For the correct interpretation of the “electronic nose” results,
               we used the doctor's diagnosis, their description of the
               condition and the severity of the lesion, which was defined by
               the results of microbiological research in the laboratory. At the
               first stage, it was established that to ensure the reliability of
               solution-making during sample ranking into groups, time from the
               moment of biomaterial sampling to the measurement should not
               exceed 3–5 min. At the appointment in the doctor's office and as
               part of a preventative medical check-up, there were analyzed 83
               bioassays according to the developed method. To elaborate a model
               of gynecological status assessment, there were chosen 30
               conditionally healthy patients (scheduled patient care) and the
               ones with deviations from the conditional norm, suggesting
               antibacterial treatment with various inflammation histories
               (active form, remission, and exacerbation). To make a decision,
               we utilized the full amount of data, which is achieved while
               measuring volatile molecules above mucus during sorption (80 sec)
               and spontaneous desorption (120 sec). The methods and results of
               experimental processing of patients’ data obtained directly in a
               consulting room are described below. The most informative sensors
               were identified applying an unsupervised model for processing the
               output curves in bio-sample vapours. The reduction of the number
               of sensors in the array to one was justified. There was proved
               high accuracy of mucus sample ranking by presence/ absence of
               gynecologic disease within mere 60 s. Sensors’ data processing
               was carried out using machine-learning methods without a coach
               but with the pseudo markup. We proposed a self-learning model for
               bioassay separation into three classes based on the signals from
               the most sensitive sensor with a classification error of no more
               than 10\%. We conducted distribution into diagnostic groups and
               verification of the correct classification of new samples
               according to the results of microbiological analysis for
               microflora and key cells, according to the culture test method
               for infectious agents of sexually transmitted diseases
               (Gardnerella, Candida. alb, ureaplasmosis Ureap. Parvum,
               Trichomonas vaginalis). For accurate confirmation of pathogens’
               presence, the polymerase chain reaction method was used. The
               model allows us to predict processes of remission and the
               presence of previous illnesses in remission, not necessarily
               infectious (e.g., adhesion formation). Active inflammation
               processes of any nature are also predicted well. Characteristics
               of the model for prediction of the presence of sexually
               transmitted infections by the signals of one sensor are
               sensitivity – 64\%, and specificity – 86\%. The capacity of an
               analysis based on the developed method and the model constitutes
               30–35 samples per shift. The minimal lifetime of the studied
               sensors with bio-hydroxyapatite phase is more than 12 months. In
               such a case, there was neither sensor calibration nor their
               training on test substances required. A comparative study was
               conducted to validate the accuracy of using the electronic nose
               system versus classic cultural and polymerase chain reaction
               methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",

               attributes when they were mixed in equal quantities. However, the

               ∼30–33\% higher bioremediation than individual consortia of

               algal AFDW, 13\% higher bacterial CFU mL−1, 82\% lower dissolved
               oxygen, and 62\% higher bicarbonates were reported as compared to

  abstract  = "Nanoparticles (NPs) have been recognized as the agents that can
               improve the oil recovery given their positive impact on the
               surface wettability of rocks. However, their impacts on the
               interfacial tension (IFT) of the two-phase fluid in a reservoir
               have not been widely reported. Given the significant impact of
               IFT on the oil recovery, it is important to develop an NPs based
               approach that not only alter the surface wettability but also
               reduce the IFT. This may be accomplished by combining nanofluids
               with low salinity water (LSW). In the present study, LSW and NPs
               are combined to study their impacts on the IFT of a two-phase
               flow system with water and oil. IFTs of different solutions with
               nano glass flakes (NGFs) and nano silica (Ns) were measured in
               the presence of monovalent and divalent salt ions. The results
               obtained were analysed using two different models as a function
               of time. It was found that NGFs and Ns have similar efficiency in
               reducing the IFT and can reveal an optimum performance once their
               concentration reaches 24.8\% in the solution. It was observed
               that, unlike Ns, IFT can be further reduced by LWS in the
               presence of NGFs. In fact, reduction of salinity up to 3500 ppm
               can decrease the IFT in the NGFs solution by the salting-in
               effect or migration of oil components. Changing the pH of the
               system can also reduce the IFT, but fluctuations was observed
               once pH goes beyond 9. It appeared that the tension in the
               interface between water and oil reduces over time and the effect
               of adsorption time is significantly higher on the solutions with
               nanoparticles. It was concluded that combining NGFs with LSW not
               only reduces the concentration of NPs needed and can make the
               project economically feasible, but also favourably change the IFT
               during the flooding process. The findings of this study may help
               to understand how LSW, and nanofluids can be employed together
               for a better oil recovery. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",

               (Ca5(PO4)3OH, HAP) surface for the rapid and selective adsorption
               of 90Sr from groundwater. The modification was achieved by the
               post-substitution of cations (Na+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Ba2+, Fe3+, and
               Al3+) for parent Ca2+ within surface structure of HAP. The
               diffraction patterns of modified HAP showed a slight shift of the
               (002) peak between 25° and 27° 2θ depending the ionic radius of
               the substituted cation. Magnesium substituted HAP, Mg-HAP,
               exhibited the highest removal efficiency (>95\%) for 10 ppm of
               Sr2+, which is attributable to the higher ion-exchange affinity
               of substituted Mg2+ than parent Ca2+ toward Sr2+. The results of
               various analyses revealed that Mg substitution dominantly
               occurred at the CaI site of HAP, which enabled the Mg-HAP to
               adsorb Sr2+ at both of CaI and CaII sites whereas bare HAP could
               adsorb Sr2+ mainly at CaII site. Adsorption isotherms and the
               kinetics of Mg-HAP for Sr2+ were evaluated using a bi-Langmuir
               isotherm and a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, which
               demonstrated the Mg-HAP exhibited the highest adsorption capacity
               (64.69 mg/g) and fastest adsorption kinetics (0.161–1.714
               g/(mg·min)) than previously modified HAPs. In the presence of
               competing cations at circumneutral pHs, the enhanced performance
               of the Mg-HAP led to a greater than 97\% reduction of 90Sr
               (initial radioactivity = 9500 Bq/L) within 1 h. The distribution
               coefficient of Mg-HAP was 1.3–6.6 × 103 mL/g while that of bare
               HAP was 1.2–6.6 × 102 mL/g. The findings in the present study
               highlight that the ion-exchange affinity of CaI and CaII sites on
               HAP surface plays a key-role in 90Sr uptake. The proposed
               modification method can simply increase the affinity of HAP
               surface, therefore, this work can further improve the deployment
               of an in situ remediation technology for 90Sr contaminated
               groundwater, i.e., Mg-HAP-based permeable reactive barrier. ©

  abstract  = "The need for clean, safe, and unpolluted water has recently
               become an important issue. Industrial processes such as
               petrochemical, pharmaceutical, pulp, and paper industries emit
               organic products in water, such as phenols, which are extremely
               toxic to aquatic life. The severe operating conditions, such as
               high pressure and temperature, of the conventional chemical
               oxidation processes of phenols cost a lot and limited the
               extensive application of the process. The present work depicts
               the development of a highly efficient and rapid oxidation process
               in an oscillating baffled reactor (OBR) to allow continuous and
               safe phenol removal under moderate operating conditions. Phenol
               conversion was studied as a function of initial concentration
               (300–500 ppm), pH (3–5), residence time (1–5 min), at constant
               amplitude (A = 4 mm), and frequency (f = 4 Hz) of oscillation and
               room temperature to achieve up to 94.6\%. At 70 °C, 300 ppm
               starting concentration, pH = 3, 4 Hz frequency, and 4 mm
               amplitude, an exceptional removal of 99.858\% phenol was achieved
               without additional extraction in just 3 min by optimizing the
               working parameters. This is a significant improvement over
               comparable processes at this temperature, and it was done in a
               reactor that scales up reliably, so this performance can likely
               be replicated on a large scale. Also, the present process was
               safe as it produced a nil concentration of the hazardous Fenton
               intermediate compounds. © 2021 The Author(s)",

               whereby the CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were decorated with a gold
               shell through crystal growth. X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments
               showed that CoFe2O4 particles crystallized in a spinel structure
               (6 nm diameter). The XRD experiments for CoFe2O4@Au nanocomposite
               showed the presence of cubic gold nanocrystals confirming the
               presence of gold. Further experiments conducted using
               Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed the
               typical bands observed for the coordination around the
               tetrahedral and octahedral sites of CoFe2O4 particles. The
               evolution of the synthesis was also tracked through FTIR by
               observing the peaks attributed to the silica stretching bands on
               the surface of the APTES functionalized CoFe2O4 nanoparticles and
               the displacement of the ferrite peaks suggest the gold shell on
               the surface of the cobalt ferrite nanoparticles throughout the
               nanocomposite. UV–Vis spectroscopy showed a red shift in the
               spectra for CoFe2O4@Au when compared to spectra produced for
               CoFe2O4. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were
               obtained for both CoFe2O4 nanoparticles and CoFe2O4@Au
               nanocomposite. The images showed a difference in the size of the
               particles after the formation of the nanocomposite. Physical
               property measurements (PPMS) were performed to study the magnetic
               properties for both newly synthesized gold-coated nanocomposite
               and those without the gold. The study revealed superparamagnetic
               behavior for both samples and demonstrated that the addition of
               the Au shell has no influence on the block temperature, thus the
               particle growth is due to the gold coating. The magnetic
               properties were further examined using the Langevin model. This
               study found that the plasmonic gold behavior did not alter the
               magnetic properties of the particles and that instead the
               magnetic properties of CoFe2O4@Au are maintained which can be

               used for disinfecting the feedwater, remains a biggest challenge.
               Herein for the first time, we report an electrochemical chlorine
               reduction on a conductive RO membrane interface as a sustainable
               solution to overcome this limitation. In this study, cyclic
               voltammetry was employed to investigate the potential of
               electrochemical chlorine reduction. Later, a conductive RO
               membrane with an embedded carbon nanotubes layer (CNT-RO) was
               fabricated, and its resistance to chlorine was tested via batch
               soaking into a sodium hypochlorite solution (NaOCl; 1,000 ppm; pH
               = 5) used as the chlorine source, followed by the flux and salt
               rejection monitoring. The CNT-RO membrane resulted in 3.5\% and
               9.3\% chlorine uptake after chlorinating for 1 h and 24 h, hence
               faced prominent decline in the amide II and aromatic amide peak
               positioned at 1541 cm−1 and 1609 cm−1, respectively. In contrast,
               the application of 2 V on conductive CNT-RO membrane interface
               when used as a cathode resulted in an irreversible chlorine
               reduction, hence formed chloride as validated via ion
               chromatography. Chlorination of CNT-RO membrane under conducting
               mode could not cause any significant change in the membrane
               morphology, elemental composition, amide bonding structure, and
               surface wettability. Therefore, CNT-RO membrane demonstrated 88\%
               rejection against monovalent salt even after 24 h of chlorination
               under conducting mode as compared to the commercial and CNT-RO
               (chlorinated without DC charge application) which showed 69\% and
               74\% rejection, respectively. These findings clearly illustrated
               the potential of conductive RO membrane for sustainable
               desalination and water reuse applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",

               control in human populations, the promising way of combating the
               disease is by controlling vector mosquito larvae and their
               breeding habitats. Water quality characteristics of the breeding
               habitats of dengue vectors are among the crucial parameters that
               determine the female mosquito's oviposition and breeding.
               Therefore, a cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate
               the habitat characteristics of dengue vector mosquitoes by
               assessing the water quality of positive breeding habitats using
               the weighted arithmetic water quality index (WQI). The present
               study was conducted in domestic areas of the selected medical
               officer of health areas of the Gampaha district, Sri Lanka, from
               2017 to 2019. Water quality characteristics of breeding
               habituations were measured and analyzed. The relationship between
               water quality parameters in breeding habitats with the occurrence
               of mosquito species was assessed using Kruskal-Wallis one-way
               analysis of variance, followed by pairwise comparison using
               Dunn's test and Mann-Whitney U test at a 5\% level of

               mosquito breeding water ranged between 25.3 and 39.8 °C, and bred
               at temperatures as high as 39.8 °C in discarded receptacles. The
               results indicated that Ae. aegypti was prominent in alkaline
               water ranging between 7.5 and 8.5 pH, whereas Ae. albopictus was
               abundant in water with a pH range of 6.5–7.5. Both species of
               Aedes inhabited waters of low turbidity and TDS level. Ae.
               aegypti and Ae. albopictus immatures were prominent in water
               where TDS levels ranged between 250 and 350 ppm. The mean
               conductivity in the mosquito breeding water was recorded as 228.3
               ± 63.9 µs/cm. The study revealed that Aedes mosquitoes could
               breed in water with a mean dissolved oxygen level of 6.9 ± 0.7
               mg/L, ranging between 6.35 ± 1.09 mg/L and 7.28 ± 0.26 mg/L. The

               dots/graphite phase carbon nitride (GQDs/CN) heterojunctions were
               proposed as efficient visible-light responsive photocatalysts for
               NO treatment under the guidance of density function theory (DFT)
               simulation. Then, the GQDs/CN was synthesized via hydrothermal
               combination of GQDs and g-C3N4 (CN) produced from pyrolysis of
               citric acid (CA) and melamine, respectively. Afterwards, the
               GQDs/CN composite samples were characterized using XRD, XPS,
               FE-SEM, TEM, HR-TEM, BET, UV–Vis DRS, PL, photocurrent tests, and
               EIS. Later, the photocatalytic activity of the prepared GQDs/CN
               composites was evaluated by degrading NO at ppm level under
               visible light irradiation at conditions of 20 ppm of NO, 5\% of
               O2, and 50\% of relative humidity. Results show that 9GQDs/CN
               outperforms its counterparts. Compared to CN, the 9GQDs/CN
               increases the NO conversion rate from 61\% to 90\%, the
               selectivity of nitrate formation from 53\% to 74\%, and the value
               of DeNOx index from −0.25 to 0.19. The enhanced performance
               results from the inclusion of GQDs, which increases the specific
               surface area, promotes the absorption of light, boosts the
               separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, and inhibits
               their recombination. Furthermore, we used active species

               degrees of partial melting. Significant depletion of middle rare
               earth element in the clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene implies that

               LREE and have a boninite-like affinity. In the dunites, olivines

  abstract  = "Low salinity waterflooding (LSWF) is considered as a potentially
               promising approach to improve oil production from petroleum
               reservoirs. Nevertheless, ambiguities about dominant mechanisms
               and influential factors controlling the wettability alteration on
               rock surface still remain elusive. To date, the main attention
               has been given to securitizing the impact of salinity, oil
               composition, rock surface characteristics, and cationic part of
               the brine, largely overlooking the impact of anionic components
               of the brine. However, this is of great importance and interest
               to clarify how the anionic component of salt can contribute to
               rock-brine interface characteristics. In this paper, we used
               Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation technique to characterize the
               effect of anionic components of brine solution on intermolecular
               interactions at the montmorillonite-brine interface. Here, the
               emphasis was put on NaCl and Na2SO4 brine solution to compare the
               ionic behavior of Cl- and SO42- in terms of distribution adjacent
               to the clay surface, potential for ionic aggregation formation,
               and pairwise interactions over a salinity range of 2000 ppm to
               70000 ppm. Results obtained from this research work show that
               anionic SO42- accumulate nearby the clay surface in the form of
               ionic aggregations with Na+ cations, compared to the Cl- anions,
               which are uniformly distribute over the clay surface. The strong
               propensity of SO42- towards Na+ reduces the possibility of
               hydration by water molecules, disintegrating the bridging role of
               Na+ to adsorb oil constituents onto the clay surface.
               Furthermore, the disparate adsorption of SO42--Na+ aggregation
               onto the clay slab hinders oil diffusion toward the surface.
               Finally, besides salinity, anionic components of brine solution
               have no effect on expansion of the electrical double layer (EDL),
               casting a shadow on this phenomenon as a driving factor of
               LSWI-EOR. The results obtained from this research work can
               further our understanding of clay-brine interaction which is a
               major mechanism behind low salinity effect in clay-bearing

               data demonstrated the chemical modification of the surface of the

               group, expose the sulfonate groups on the surface of the
               SPION-HBS. The anionic groups modify the surface charge
               distribution of the nanoparticles, shifting the isoelectric point
               of the nanoparticles from pH 6.3 (SPION) to less than pH 2
               (SPION-HBS). This fact affords greater stability, supporting the
               drastic conditions of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) application.
               The interfacial properties of these particles were also
               investigated, revealing a slight reduction in the interfacial
               tension (IFT) of the nanofluid/oil, and small changes in the
               contact angle (CA) measured as a decane droplet on a glass
               surface. Despite the slight reduction in IFT and CA, spontaneous
               imbibition experiments showed a dramatic improvement in oil
               production in the nanofluid group, reaching a relative value of
               2.75 times greater than in the control, at the end of the 5-month
               trial. The higher oil production achieved with the SPION-HBS
               nanofluid can be attributed to a more efficient change in
               wettability, reflecting the role of electrostatic interactions
               between the sulfonate groups at the particle surface and the
               porous surface of limestone rock. Since there was no surfactant
               in the composition of the nanofluid, the observed effects can
               only be attributed to the influence of the nanoparticles in the

               metallogenic regularity are of high importance. Skarn deposits
               are one of the important sources of critical minerals resources.
               Yaojialing deposit is a typical large skarn zinc polymetallic
               deposit in Tongling district of the Middle and Lower Yangtze
               River metallogenic belt. The ore bodies are mainly lenticular and
               veined occurrence along the proximal skarn zone and structural or
               lithologic contacts, respectively. We recognize five hydrothermal
               stages in the deposit: skarn stage, oxide stage, early sulfide
               stage, late sulfide stage and carbonate stage. The early and late
               sulfide stages are the main ore-forming stages. In addition to
               the production of zinc, gold and copper, the deposit also
               contains critical element resources such as cadmium, cobalt,
               selenium, and tellurium. Taking the Yaojialing deposit as an
               example, this paper shows the occurrence and distribution of
               critical minerals resources in a typical skarn deposit by using
               scanning electron microscope, TESCAN integrated mineral analyzer
               (TIMA), and sulfide LA-ICP MS analysis. Although there are no
               cadmium minerals in Yaojialing deposit, cadmium can incorporated
               in the sphalerite lattice, and sphalerite in veins has elevated
               cadmium content (average 5478.78 ppm). Tellurium content in
               various sulfides is very low, and it does not enter into the
               sulfide lattice. It mainly forms tellurobismuthite, hessite and
               tetradymite, which occur in Cu-Zn ore formed in the early sulfide
               stage, there are 227 tetradymite grains in a single rock section.
               Selenium occurs as naumannite in vein ore in the distal of the
               deposit; selenium can also incorporated the lattice of
               chalcopyrite and sphalerite, and the selenium content is elevated
               in sphalerite formed in the early sulfide stage (average 226.80
               ppm). The cobalt mineral glaucodot is only found in skarn ore;
               cobalt easily incorporated the lattice of pyrite and sphalerite,
               and pyrite and sphalerite formed in the early sulfide stage are
               enriched in cobalt (average 1962.18 ppm). The characteristics of
               trace elements in pyrite and sphalerite show that temperature is
               the main factor affecting the distribution of critical minerals
               resources, high temperature is conducive to the enrichment of
               cobalt, selenium and tellurium, while low temperature is
               conducive to the enrichment of cadmium. Cadmium, cobalt,
               selenium, and tellurium have high content in specific parts of
               the deposit, which makes them potentially amenable to recovery. ©

               types of pyrites, i.e., pyrite 1 (Py1), 2 (Py2), 3 (Py3), 4
               (Py4), and ore pyrite (OPy), were identified in the Lannigou Au
               deposit. Py1, Py2, and Py3 were mainly observed in the wall rock,
               whereas Py4 and OPy, constituting the core and rim of zoned
               pyrite, respectively, were only discovered in the ore. Mineral
               mapping of the wall rock and ore indicated that pyrite is scarce
               in the wall rock (0.021 vol\%). However, the amount of zoned
               pyrite significantly increased in the ore (1.275 vol\%). Py1,
               Py2, and Py3, showing framboidal, nodular, and fine euhedral
               microcrystal textures, had high Pb, Co, Ni, Mn, Zn, and Mo
               contents (medians ranging from 10 to 1,000 ppm) and variable δ34S
               compositions ranging from −5.1 to 35.4‰, implying a sedimentary
               (syngenetic or diagenetic) origin. Py4 was homogeneous and
               contained numerous illite and quartz inclusions and fractures. In
               contrast, OPy showed multiple As-rich sub-bands and a lack of
               illite or quartz inclusions and fractures. Py4 had significantly
               lower Au, As, Tl, and Cu contents than OPy; however, Py4 had Pb,
               Co, Ni, Mn, Zn, and Mo contents similar to OPy. The range of δ34S
               values for Py4 and OPy were both narrow, but Py4 (7.6 to 13.3‰,
               with an average of 9.1‰) had lower δ34S values than OPy
               (9.4–14.1‰, with an average of 12.4‰). These texture and chemical
               features indicate that Py4 likely sedimented from a pre-ore
               hydrothermal fluid, but not at the early stage of the ore-forming
               fluid. Hydrothermal pyrite cores were also widespread and
               exhibited textural and chemical differences compared to Au-rich
               pyrite rims from other Au deposits in the Youjiang Basin. Based
               on the two geochronological clusters of Au deposits in the
               Youjiang Basin, we inferred the occurrence of at least two
               episodes of large-scale hydrothermal events. The two hydrothermal
               fluid episodes, which contributed to the zoned pyrite formation,
               likely originated from the mixing of initial magmatic fluid with
               δ34S values of ∼0 ± 5‰ and basin brine with elevated δ34S values
               (δ34S > 18‰). Pre-ore hydrothermal pyrite likely resulted in the
               rapid non-equilibrium crystallization of ore pyrite; thus, more
               Carlin-suite elements were captured by ore pyrite. Additionally,
               low-grade Au orebodies may have locally formed during the pre-ore
               hydrothermal event. These multiple hydrothermal events may have
               been crucial for the formation of massive Carlin-type Au deposits
               in the Youjiang Basin. © 2022 The Author(s)",

               overlap with bulk-silicate earth, for Mt. Kıra basalts, provide
               evidence for the mafic juvenile lower crustal assimilation by
               OIB-like basaltic magmas derived from a common enriched mantle
               source. High Ba/La, Ba/Ta, Ba/Nb, Zr/Nb, and low Nb/La, La/Sm,
               Nb/Th, La/Yb, and Dy/Yb ratios, which coincide with those of
               Syrian lower crustal xenoliths, appears as geochemical hallmarks
               for decoupling of juvenile lower crust assimilated Mt. Kıra, NW
               Syria and some of KVC basalts from least contaminated ones in
               Arabian Foreland. The enrichments in Y, Fe, and Ti and depletions
               in Al and Sr in Mt. Kıra lavas, however, are attributed to
               post-eruptive chemical weathering processes. Based on
               petrological and tectonic data, it is proposed that the northern
               Arabian Foreland Cenozoic volcanism was triggered by the combined
               effect of both collision- and mantle flow-driven forces with a
               kinematic linkage. Asthenospheric mantle flow and upwelling,
               which supply a thermal source, caused the deep mantle processes
               and interaction between asthenosphere and lithosphere, which was
               formed the amphibole-bearing garnet lherzolitic
               (asthenospherized) metasomes (mantle flow-induced metasomatism)
               at the base of the SCLM accreted from the ductile asthenosphere,
               prior to partial melting. Partial melting of such re-fertilized
               metasomes and surrounding wall rock was most likely produced
               hybrid parental magmas via mixing variable proportions of melt
               fractions from a garnet lherzolite source with melt fractions
               from an amphibole-bearing garnet lherzolite source. On the other
               hand, concurrently running of collision-induced temporarily
               changing regional stress -compressional or extensional- regimes
               caused i) the development of surface tectonic structures in a
               dynamic topography that reactivated the pre-Neogene deep tectonic
               structures, ii) multiphase rapid uplifts, and iii) prominent deep
               channeling for the upwelling enriched mantle-derived hybrid
               magmas to penetrate. The shallow level lower crustal assimilation
               of this OIB-like hybrid mantle melts, generated the Mt. Kıra, NW

               important role in biodiesel and biolubricant production, with the
               possible implementation of biorefineries to replace refineries
               based on petroleum. The oxidative stability of the original
               sample will influence the quality of the intermediate and final
               products, recommending highly stable raw materials or the use of
               antioxidants to keep quality parameters during storage. The aim
               of this work was to obtain a stable biolubricant, assessing its
               production through a double transesterification with methanol and
               pentaerythritol from high-oleic safflower oil and adding
               antioxidants, paying attention to quality parameters.
               Consequently, a biorefinery that produced high-quality products
               was proposed. In conclusion, high biodiesel and biolubricant
               yields were obtained (>97 and >94\%, respectively) with the
               following chemical conditions for the latter: FAME/alcohol ratio,
               1:0.33; pressure, 260 mmHg; catalyst concentration, 1.0\%;
               temperature, 160 °C. The oxidative stability of biodiesel
               complied with the standard (10.78 h) due to its high methyl
               oleate content (exceeding 80\%), whereas this parameter was
               shorter for the biolubricant (2.86 h), possibly due to its
               molecular structure. Consequently, antioxidant addition was
               needed, and tert-Butylhydroquinone at low concentration (500 ppm)
               kept viscosity and acid number of high-oleic safflower
               biolubricant during oxidation conditions (up to 8 h). However,
               tannic acid did not keep these properties in biolubricant. In
               conclusion, by using the right antioxidant, all the products of
               the proposed biorefinery were stable during oxidizing conditions,
               making this biorefinery more competitive. © 2022 The Authors",

               coupled with relatively high modal proportions of clinopyroxene
               (5–8\%) and a remarkably wide range in clinopyroxene Mg\#
               (0.91–0.94), interpreted to reflect high degrees of partial
               melting followed by modal and chemical metasomatic
               refertilization. A fractional partial melting model of
               orthopyroxene trace elements in a depleted mantle indicates
               20–30\% of melting. Clinopyroxenes show two groups based on their
               CaO contents (18.7–18.9 and 20.6–22.6 wt \%) suggesting a
               secondary origin and modal metasomatism. The low Ca
               clinopyroxenes were the latest to be formed, and the wide range
               of clinopyroxene Mg\# shows a lack of equilibrium with the
               coexisting minerals. The high Ca clinopyroxenes record ancient
               metasomatic events that are also documented in orthopyroxene.
               Cryptic metasomatism is shown by strong progressive enrichments
               in LREEs and MREEs of orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene. Th vs La
               and Sr vs Nd of clinopyroxene are used to identify different
               generations of metasomatism. Ti/Eu vs (La/Yb)N and Zr/Hf
               systematics indicate that the metasomatising agent has both a
               carbonatite and a silicate component. The structural hydroxyl
               contents of the different mineral phases are very low (<1 ppm for
               olivine, 40–48 ppm for orthopyroxene and 164–277 ppm for
               clinopyroxene). The very low water contents compared to typical
               sub-continental peridotites could be attributed to the depleted
               nature of the xenoliths or reflect lower water activities of
               carbonatitic melts relative to alkaline melts. Estimated fO2
               values expressed as ΔlogFMQ, (where FMQ corresponds to the
               fayalite magnetite-quartz oxygen buffer) range from -0.42 to
               -0.26 and are consistent with minor OH stretching regions of 3520
               cm-1 in orthopyroxene, related to a ferric iron defect. The
               combination of textural investigations, major, and trace element
               and H2O data suggests that a refractory subcontinental mantle was
               affected by several episodes of intraplate metasomatism dominated

               is currently deemed as a promising pathway to overcome the
               shortage of freshwater resources, but solar water evaporation
               material suﬀers from serious salt-fouling, low freshwater yield,
               and poor long-term performance in seawater. Herein, a Janus
               photothermal porous ﬁbrous membrane, composed of hydrophobic
               MXene/Poly(dimethylsiloxane) coatings and a hydrophilic
               polylactic acid/TiO2 nanofluids porous fibrous membrane, was
               prepared. During the solar-driven seawater desalination process,
               the hydrophilic fibrous membrane, functioned as salt-rejection
               barrier, induced by TiO2 nanofluids and transport seawater to the
               surface through its microporous channels; the MXene/PDMS coatings
               acted as a photothermal layer and generated localized heat at the
               water-vapor interface upon light irradiation. The solar-thermal
               test results show that, the Janus porous ﬁbrous membrane displays
               stable solar-thermal conversion efficiency of 60\%, freshwater
               yield of 1 kg m-2 h-1 and low ion concentration (≤1 ppm) under 1
               sun irradiation in direct contact mode, which is superior to
               other literatures reported. With synergistic effect of TiO2
               nanofluids and MXene, the Janus fibrous membrane exhibits a high
               salt rejection rate of 99.95\%, and antibacterial activity as
               high as of 100\%. Notably, beneﬁting from opposite wettability of
               Janus porous fibrous membrane, the as-prepared membranes also
               display excellent separation flux and high separation accuracy
               (>99.95\%) in various surfactant-stabilized oil/water emulsions.
               It is anticipated that this versatility of Janus porous fibrous
               membrane has excellent photothermal conversion capability and
               separation properties, making it have great application potential
               in using sustainable solar energy to collect freshwater from

               emerging high-tech and green-energy industries, generating
               tremendous REY demand in recent decades. Recently, many
               sedimentary phosphorites have been reported to have extraordinary
               REY enrichment (> 1000 ppm) and may become new REY resources.
               However, the controls of REY enrichment in phosphorites have not
               been well constrained. To better understand the discrepant REY
               enrichment in phosphorites, the early Cambrian high-REY Zhijin
               (ZJ) phosphorites (∼500–2000 ppm) and the relatively low-REY
               Meishucun (MSC, ∼200–400 ppm) and Xia'an (X'A, mostly < 200 ppm)
               phosphorites on the Yangtze Block of South China were
               investigated with mineralogy, bulk-rock elements, total organic
               carbon, in-situ elements, and Zn-Fe isotopes. The mineral
               characteristics, REY indexes, and in-situ REY mapping indicate
               that the X'A phosphorites may represent pristine phosphorites,
               whereas the ZJ and MSC phosphorites may have experienced
               intensive diagenetic alteration. Diagenetic alteration can only
               explain the REY enrichment in the MSC phosphorites compared to
               the pristine X'A phosphorites, but it does not sufficiently
               explain the extraordinary REY enrichment in the ZJ phosphorites.
               Additionally, the lower δ66Zn values of the ZJ and X'A
               phosphorites (δ66Znaverage = 0.16‰ and 0.14‰, respectively) than
               those of the MSC phosphorites (δ66Znaverage = 0.75‰) indicate
               higher productivity levels in the ZJ and X'A areas. However, the
               high-productivity X'A phosphorites yielded very low REY
               concentrations, indicating that the extraordinary REY enrichment
               in the ZJ phosphorites cannot be ascribed to high productivity
               levels. Notably, the ZJ phosphorites may have experienced more
               intensive Fe redox cycling under fluctuating oxic–suboxic
               deposition conditions (∼0.0‰–0.45‰ δ56Fe values in near-pure
               phosphorites) than the MSC and X'A phosphorites with completely
               oxic deposition conditions (∼0.0‰ δ56Fe values). Frequent Fe
               redox cycling can greatly enrich REYs in porewater, which can be
               subsequently transferred into francolites during its formation
               and early diagenesis. Therefore, frequent Fe redox cycling driven
               by fluctuating oxic–suboxic seawater conditions may be
               responsible for the extraordinary REY enrichment in the ZJ
               phosphorites. If this is the case, we propose that phosphorites
               deposited near the oxic–suboxic redox chemocline are favorable
               for extraordinary REY enrichment, such as the coeval near-slope
               phosphate concretions on the Yangtze Block and other phosphorites
               or phosphatic rocks formed in different basins at different
               geological times. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",

               Catechin is a bioactive compound which is found abundantly in
               green tea. In this paper, MIPs was synthesized by precipitation

               respectively. Surface morphology in the MIPs by scanning electron
               microscopy (SEM) demonstrated spheres with nanometric scale.
               Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of the polymers
               showed that catechin molecule was captured in the network
               copolymers. Porosity of the polymers were analyzed using Brouneur
               Emmet Teller (BET) technique. Based on BET analysis, specific
               surface area of the MIPs was 45.5 m2.g-1 while it was 42.2 m2.g-1
               for non-imprinted polymers (NIPs). It means that the imprinting
               process was carried out successfully. Adsorption properties of
               the polymers were characterized too. The best binding capacity of
               the MIPs was reported equal to 440 mg. g-1 in 750 ppm of the feed
               concentration whereas it was 84mg.g-1 for quercetin (similar
               structure of catechin). It confirms that the MIPs technology can
               be introduced as a good candidate for separation process with a
               satisfactory result in selectivity. The binding capacity of the
               MIPs was evaluated for natural extract of green tea using a
               high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) device which
               similar results were obtained. According to above mentioned
               results, separation and pre-concentration of the bioactive

               extensive use in other industrial processes, there is the
               potential for unintended release and spills into soils and
               aquifers. In these subsurface systems it is likely that methanol
               will be readily biodegraded; however, degradation may lead to the
               production of by-products, most importantly methane possibly
               resulting in explosion hazards and volatile fatty acids (VFAs)
               causing aesthetic issues for groundwater. In this study, the
               formation of these potentially harmful by-products due to
               methanol biodegradation was investigated in natural sand and silt
               sediments using microcosms inoculated with neat methanol (100\%)
               ranging in concentration from 100 to 100,000 ppm. To assess the
               rate of degradation and by-product formation, water and headspace
               samples were collected and analyzed for methanol, volatile fatty
               acids (VFAs, including acetic, butyric, and propionic acid),
               cation (metal) concentrations (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn and Na),
               microbial community structure and activity, headspace pressure,
               gas composition (CH4, CO2, O2 and N2), and compound specific
               isotopes. Methanol was completely biodegraded in sand and silt up
               to concentrations of 1000 ppm and 10,000 ppm, respectively.
               Degradation was initially aerobic, consuming oxygen (O2) and
               producing carbon dioxide (CO2). When O2 was depleted, the
               microcosms became anaerobic and a lag in methanol degradation
               occurred (ranging from 41 to 87 days). Following this lag,
               methanol was preferentially degraded to acetate, coupled with CO2
               reduction. Microcosms with high methanol concentrations (10,000
               ppm) were driven further down the redox ladder and exhibited
               fermentation, leading to concurrent acetate and methane (CH4)
               generation. In all cases acetate was an intermediate product,
               further degraded to the final products of CH4 and CO2. Carbonates
               present in the microcosm sediments helped buffer VFA
               acidification and replenished CO2. Methane generation in the
               anaerobic microcosms was short-lived, but temporarily reached
               high rates up to 13 mg kg−1 day−1. Under the conditions of these
               experiments, methanol degradation occurred rapidly, after initial
               lag periods, which were a function of methanol concentration and
               sediment type. Our experiment also showed that methanol
               degradation and associated methane production can occur in a
               stepwise fashion. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",

               western part of the belt and adjacent to the super-large Zhunuo
               porphyry Cu deposit. There are three epochs of magmatism at
               Beimulang, including pre-mineralization quartz porphyry (PQP;
               49.7 ± 0.4 Ma), inter-mineralization monzogranite porphyry (IMGP;
               14.8 ± 0.2 Ma), monzogranite (IMG; 14.1 ± 0.2 Ma), and
               late-mineralization granite porphyry (LGP; 11.7 ± 0.1 Ma). The
               various degrees of alteration and sulfide occurred at the IMG(P)
               and LGP indicate that there are at least two episodes of fluid
               exsolution events associated with different intrusions spanning ∼
               3 m.y. at Beimulang, which are unlike other Gangdese porphyry Cu
               deposits showing single fluid exsolution around only one porphyry
               at Miocene (e.g., Qulong, Zhunuo, Dabu). The PQP is characterized
               by high SiO2 (75.6–81.4 wt\%) and K2O (2.1–4.3 wt\%)
               concentrations, high Nb/Ta (8.4–11.3) ratios, and low Mg\#
               (22–43), Ni (1.5–2.7 ppm) contents. They have high (87Sr/86Sr)i
               (0.705098–0.707767) ratios and low εNd(t) (-4.9 to −1.9) values.
               These geochemical characteristics indicate that they were
               probably derived from a juvenile basaltic lower crust during the
               ongoing Indian-Asian collision. The IMGP and IMG show similar
               petrography and geochemical characteristics, such as high SiO2
               (65.0–69.8 wt\%), K2O (3.6–4.3 wt\%), Sr (550–809 ppm) contents,
               high Sr/Y (79–89) ratios, and low Mg\# (43–48), Th/Yb, and Nb/Yb
               values, combined with high (87Sr/86Sr)i (0.707254–0.708017) and
               low εNd(t) (-7.9 to −6.0), implying a similar source probably
               originated in the subduction-modified lower crust metasomatized
               by Neo-Tethyan oceanic slab-derived fluids. The LGP displays
               trends produced by fractionation of magma with a composition
               similar to the IMG(P), but wall rock assimilation plays a
               significant role during magmatic evolution. Zircons from the
               IMG(P) show higher Eu/Eu* (>0.3), 10000*(Eu/Eu*)/Y (>4), and
               (Ce/Nd)/Y (>0.04) ratios than those of the PQP, indicating the
               fertile magmas were more oxidized and hydrous. The high magmatic
               oxidation state for the IMG(P) is also supported by using the
               zircon (ΔFMQ = +4.1 to + 6.1), and amphibole (ΔFMQ =+2.6 to +
               3.4) oxybarometers. Their high magmatic water contents are
               supported by evaluations using amphibole (∼3.5 wt\%) and
               plagioclase (∼6.7 wt\%) compositions, respectively. However, the
               LGP has higher magmatic oxygen fugacity (Eu/Eu* >0.3, ΔFMQ = +4.2
               to + 7.3) caused probably by auto-oxidation of the magmas, but
               lower magmatic water contents (Sr/Y = 31 ± 15; V/Sc = 6 ± 4)
               caused presumably by previous fluid exsolution and/or
               fractionation of hydrous silicate minerals during magma ascent
               than those of the IMG(P). Therefore, the highly hydrous and
               oxidized magmas with juvenile material are favorable to form
               porphyry Cu deposits in Tibetan orogen. On the contrary, magmatic
               evolution can probably reduce the water content of magma chamber,
               which is not beneficial to porphyry Cu mineralization. © 2022 The

               volcanic-hosted massive sulfide deposit (South Urals) represent
               an intercalation of thin sulfide and hyaloclastite layers up to 3
               and 0.5 cm thick. Their mineralogy and trace element, including
               rare earth elements (REE), and S, C and O isotopic geochemistry
               are considered in this work. They occur at the slopes of ore
               bodies and pinch outside them within hyaloclastites and their
               thickness increases towards the flanks of the ore bodies. The
               sulfide layers are mostly composed of authigenic pyrite, which
               forms zoned nodules, anhedral aggregates, euhedral crystals and
               pseudomorphs after pyrrhotite crystals. The pyrite nodules and
               anhedral aggregates host inclusions of authigenic chalcopyrite,
               sphalerite, galena, barite, cotunnite, native gold, stromeyerite,
               tellurobismutite and hessite. The trace element content of
               sulfide layers widely varies and depends on the amount of
               non-sulfide minerals (chlorite, illite, calcite, quartz, rutile,
               scheelite), which formed as a result of alteration of dacitic
               hyaloclastite components mixed with sulfide clasts. The sulfide
               layers are enriched in REEs (up to 561 ppm) due to the presence
               of REE-bearing minerals (bastnaesite, parisite, synchysite,
               galgenbergite, REE-bearing xenotime), which do not occur in
               massive sulfide ores. A narrow range of δ34S values of pyrite
               (1.41–3.27 ‰) from sulfide layers is explained by equilibrium or
               kinetic dissolution–precipitation processes of redeposition of
               sulfide ore clasts during diagenetic processes. The δ13C values
               of bulk samples of sulfide layers (–5.29 to –17.89 ‰) indicate
               that the authigenic carbonates formed from pore fluids circulated
               in former organic-rich hyaloclastite layers. The δ18O values of
               the same samples (+4.00 to + 8.36 ‰) are higher compared to
               seawater δ18O values due to diagenetic isotopic exchange between
               the hyaloclastitic components and pore fluids at elevated
               temperatures of burial process. The positive δ34S–Mn, δ13C–Mn,
               δ13C–As, δ13C–Sb, δ18O–Mn and δ18O–U correlations reflect organic
               matter consumption during the evolution of authigenic minerals.

               diagenetically altered layered sulfide ores in volcanic-hosted

               increased the particle size (7.44 ± 0.03–7.60 ± 0.03 μm), changed
               the smooth surface morphology to rough and converted the
               sharp-edged granules to irregular shapes. Major structural

               diffraction as crystallinity decreased (25.6–20.9\%) after

               The study on the adsorption performance shows that FF-PT have
               good adsorption and recycling performance for uranium. The study
               on the adsorption performance shows that FF-PT have good

               synthesis strategy for the synthesis of α-MoO3 materials with
               controllable structures. They were obtained by heat treatment of
               the gels containing ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate and
               glucose. Owing to the coordination interactions between glucose
               and heptamolybdate, α-MoO3-2 sample obtained by adding 1.8 g of
               glucose featured the highest oxygen vacancy concentration with an
               O/Mo atomic ratio of 2.61. The gas sensing measurements indicated
               that α-MoO3-2 had excellent sensing performances for detecting
               ethanol. Such ethanol sensor displayed the lowest detection

               in a comprehensive evaluation of their toxicity profiles through

               observed that zebrafish at the embryo and eleutheroembryo stages
               experienced significant toxic effects at a concentration of
               15-fold the recommended dosage (0.5 ppm), whereas adult zebrafish
               following long-term consumption of fodder containing Lys-CNGs
               presented no adverse effects. Further microbiota analysis
               indicated that Lys-CNGs did not cause significant changes in the

               toxicity assessments with mammalian animal models, the Lys-CNGs

  abstract  = "To ensure safe drinking water, it is necessary to have a simple
               method by which the probable pollutants are detected at the point
               of distribution. Nitrite contamination in water near agricultural
               locations could be an environmental concern due to its
               deleterious effects on the human population. The development of a
               frugal paper-based microfluidic sensor could be desirable to
               achieve the societal objective of providing safe drinking water.
               This work describes the development of a facile and
               cost-effective microfluidic paper-based sensor for quantitative
               estimation of nitrite in aquatic environments. A simple punching
               machine was used for fabrication and rapid prototyping of
               paper-based sensors without the need of any specialized equipment
               or patterning techniques. A reusable 3D printed platform served
               as the support for simultaneous testing of multiple samples. The
               nitrite estimation was carried out with smartphone-assisted
               digital image acquisition and colorimetric analysis. Under
               optimized experimental conditions, the variation in average
               grayscale intensity with concentration of nitrite was linear in
               the range from 0.1 to 10 ppm. The limits of detection and
               quantitation were 0.12 ppm and 0.35 ppm respectively. The
               reproducibility, expressed as relative standard deviation was
               1.31\%. The selectivity of nitrite detection method was
               determined by performing interference studies with commonly
               existing co-ions in water, such as bicarbonates, chloride and
               sulphate. The paper-based sensor was successfully applied for
               estimation of nitrite in actual water samples and showed high
               recoveries in the range of 83.5–109\%. The results were in good
               agreement with those obtained using spectrophotometry. The
               developed paper-based sensor method, by virtue of its simplicity,
               ease of fabrication and use, could be readily extended for
               detection of multiple analytes in resource-limited settings. ©

               ppm concentrations (referred to as MF15C25, MF15C50, and
               MF15C100). Compared to MF15, the nanofuels displayed increased
               micro-explosion intensity and reduced micro-explosion
               occurrences, both effects being more pronounced at higher MWCNTs
               loadings. This behavior is attributed to the higher surface
               tension and viscosity of the nanofuels compared to that of MF15.
               The ignition delay decreased from 2.33 s to 1.71 s, the
               combustion rate constant increased from 0.82 mm2 s−1 to 1.01 mm2

               going from pure MF15 to MF15C50. The improved combustion
               characteristics can be related to the superior thermal

               (HAPIN) trial is an ongoing multi-center randomized controlled
               trial assessing the impact of a liquified petroleum gas (LPG)
               cookstove and fuel intervention on health. Given the potential
               impacts of household air pollution (HAP) exposure from burning
               solid fuels on cardiovascular health during pregnancy, we sought
               to determine whether baseline exposures to particulate matter
               with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), black carbon (BC)
               and carbon monoxide (CO) were associated with blood pressure
               among 799 pregnant women in Tamil Nadu, India, one of the HAPIN
               trial centers. Methods: Multivariable linear regression models
               were used to examine the association between 24-h personal
               exposure to PM2.5/BC/CO and systolic and diastolic blood
               pressure, controlling for maternal age, body mass index (BMI),
               mother's education, household wealth, gestational age, and
               season. At the time of measurement, women were between 9- and
               20-weeks of gestation. Results: We found that systolic blood
               pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were higher in
               pregnant women exposed to higher levels of HAP, though only the
               result for CO and DBP reached conventional statistical
               significance (p < 0.05). We observed a positive association
               between CO and DBP among the entire study cohort: a 1-log μg/m3
               increase in CO exposure was associated with 0.36 mmHg higher DBP
               (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.02 to 0.70). The effect was
               stronger in pregnant women with higher CO exposures (in the 3rd
               [≥ 0.9 and < 2.1 ppm] and 4th quartiles [≥ 2.1 and ≤ 46.9 ppm]).
               We also found that pregnant women with PM2.5 exposures in the
               highest quartile (≥ 129.9 and ≤ 2100 μg/m3) had a borderline
               significant association (p = 0.054) with DBP compared to those
               who had PM2.5 exposures in the lowest quartile (≥ 9.4 and < 47.7
               μg/m3). No evidence of association was observed for BC exposure
               and blood pressure. Conclusion: This study contributes to limited
               evidence regarding the relationship between HAP exposure and
               blood pressure among women during pregnancy, a critical window
               for both mother and child's life-course health. Results from this
               cross-sectional study suggest that exposures to PM2.5 and CO from
               solid fuel use are associated with higher blood pressure in

               and biodegradable support of algae-sheets/CNTs. According to the

               employed to make the sensors presented hexagonal and cubic
               phases, respectively. The Ni(OH)2:Yb and the NiO:Yb were
               synthesized at 200 and 400 °C, therefore, they are named as
               NiYe200-OH and NiYe400-O, respectively. In addition, the analysis
               by scanning electron microscopy revealed that the Ni(OH)2:Yb and
               the NiO:Yb consisted in porous microparticles with sizes of 25–47
               µm and 1–25 µm, respectively. Those microparticles were the
               sensitive material for the gas detection, since the gas detection
               was not possible without them. The gas detection tests for NO2
               (100 ppm at room temperature) were firstly achieved in the unbent
               state and the sensors made with NiYe200-OH and NiYe400-O powders
               presented the lowest response/recovery times of 16/252 s and
               19/361 s, respectively. Surprisingly, the values of
               response/recovery times decreased by 37\%/16\% and by 26\%/32\%
               for the AS-CNT/NiYe200-OH and AS-CNT/NiYe400-O sensors,
               respectively, after bending them (at a radius of curvature of 0.8
               cm). The sensors were able to detect NO2 gas because they had on
               their surface oxygen vacancy defects, which acted as active sites
               for the adsorption of NO2 molecules. The presence of such defects
               was demonstrated by the XPS, absorbance and Raman measurements.
               Some advantages of the sensors were: 1) their capacity to operate
               with very low power (200–300 µW) and 2) their ability to be
               recovered for the next cycle of detection without the use of UV
               radiation or heating, which is normally used to recover the
               capacity of the sensor for gas detection. Hence, the results
               showed this work indicate that our gas sensor could be used for
               the detection of noxious gases and can be used in portable
               applications due to their compact size and light-weight. Most
               importantly, most of their mass (≈92\%) is biodegradable, making

               and dissolved inorganic (DIC), dissolved organic (DOC),
               particulate organic (POC) carbon, and their isotopes (δ13C) with
               Chlorophyll-a (Chl a) were measured in river water samples from
               26 sampling sites for characterization and source identification
               in the Yangtze River system. The estimated pCO2 varies from (120
               ppm) to (3400 ppm) with an average (1085 ppm) across the Yangtze
               River and pCO2 is almost three times oversaturated than the
               ambient air (380 ppm). The downstream sites pronounced elevated
               pCO2 than the upstream sites. The relationship of δ13CDIC and
               pCO2 indicated that pCO2 control is seasonally independent. The
               significant correlations between DOC, POC, and pCO2 revealed that
               organic carbon influenced pCO2 in the river. The seasonal
               fluctuations of pCO2 were observed with an average of (762.23
               ppm) and (1407.35 ppm) in winter and summer, respectively.
               δ13CDIC showed that the metabolic process has a negligible
               influence on DIC, δ13CDIC, and pCO2. δ13CDIC values increased
               from −8.95‰ to −4.91‰ during summer, whereas winter increased
               from −19.76‰ to −1.97‰ suggesting that DIC derived from carbonate
               weathering, dissolution of atmospheric and soil CO2. The δ13CDOC
               (−30.43‰ to −24.05‰) and δ13CPOC (−29.87‰ to −23.37‰) values
               confirmed that organic carbon mainly derived from the degradation
               of organic materials in soil. δ13CDIC revealed that anthropogenic
               sewage discharge slightly modified DIC composition. Overall, this
               study provides new insight into recent seasonal fluctuations of
               the pCO2, DOC, POC, DIC, δ13C, and their inputs. Thus, these
               variations and inputs of carbon transported by the Yangtze River
               could have a significant influence not only on the biogeochemical
               cycle and ecosystem process but also on the global carbon budget.

  abstract  = "Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) arising from the combustion of
               fuels are a significant source of air pollution. Estimating them
               for a given fuel blend is difficult, because the emissions are
               affected in a highly complex manner by several factors such as
               fuel components, fuel composition, combustor design, temperature,
               pressure, and fuel-to-air ratio. Besides, experimental emission
               studies are highly specific and limited, and simply cannot
               emulate real-life combustion systems and conditions exactly.
               Therefore, procedures to estimate NOx emissions for any given
               system/scenario would be highly useful. The present study uses
               the data from NOx emissions studies in the literature to derive
               several models for predicting NOx emissions for some useful fuel
               blends. The study is limited to the blends of ammonia, natural
               gas, hydrogen, and kerosene, and considers the effects of
               pressure, temperature, fuel to air equivalence ratio (FAR), and
               extent of premixing (α). First, simple linear models are derived
               for predicting emissions for individual fuels. Then, an
               artificial neural network (ANN) is calibrated to predict NOx
               emissions for two-fuel blends. While both models correctly
               capture the qualitative trends of emissions in the calibrated
               ranges, the ANN model is quantitatively superior. Hydrogen
               produces maximum NOx emission (5000 ppm), while, kerosene gives
               the least NOx (100 ppm). A case study on the NOx emissions from
               the evolving power sector is also provided. NOx emission exceeds
               2000 ppm and 1500 ppm for the combustion of natural gas-hydrogen
               and natural gas-ammonia blends respectively, when hydrogen and

               renewable gas turbine fuel with methane (CH4) and CO2 as major
               components, dimethyl ether (DME, CH3OCH3) was used to co-fire
               with biogas in a gas turbine model combustor in this work. Swirl
               combustion characteristics of biogas/DME mixtures under different
               DME contents in fuel mixtures (α) and CO2 contents in biogas
               mixtures (β) were measured. Numerical simulation and kinetic
               analysis were performed to provide insights into the effects of
               DME co-firing and CO2 content on combustion characteristics. It
               was observed that flame shape and flame size remain almost
               unchanged with varying DME content and CO2 content at the fixed
               air flow rate, which are associated with the nearly unchanged
               flow field. The flame displays a purple color with DME co-firing
               due to the enhanced formaldehyde (CH2O) chemiluminescence. DME
               co-firing can effectively improve the flame stability and lower
               the lean blowout limit (LBO). The decreased LBO is associated
               with the enhanced fuel reactivity, which results in the reduced
               ignition delay time and the increased laminar flame speed, OH
               peak value and high-level OH area. However, increasing CO2
               content raises LBO, which is associated with the decreased
               laminar flame speed, OH peak value and high-level OH area. The
               ignition delay time can hardly follow the LBO trend with varying
               CO2 content as it cannot account for the thermal effect caused by
               CO2 addition. Furthermore, the NO emissions increase with DME
               co-firing and exceed 20 ppm in pure DME combustion due to the
               increased temperature level and high-T area, while the amplitude
               of combustion acoustics is elevated by ∼30–70\% with increasing
               DME content. In contrast, both the NO emissions and amplitude of
               combustion acoustics attenuate with increasing CO2 content. ©

               fuel in freight transportation applications, especially the
               shipping industry. However, the problems of nitrous oxide (N2O)
               emissions, which has almost 300 times higher global warming
               impact than carbon dioxide (CO2), and ammonia slip have been the
               main challenges of using ammonia in compression ignition (CI)
               diesel engines. In this study, the effect of split diesel
               injection strategy (i.e., two-pulse diesel injection) on an
               ammonia/diesel dual-fuel (ADDF) engine is investigated under
               medium load operating conditions. Results indicate that the ADDF
               combustion mode with single diesel injection strategy achieves
               lower indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) compared to the
               corresponding diesel-only combustion mode. However, the use of
               split diesel injection strategy increases the ITE of the ADDF
               combustion mode to 39.72\% which is higher than that obtained by
               diesel-only combustion mode (maximum ITEdiesel = 38.62\%).
               Moreover, split diesel injection strategy reduces the unburned
               ammonia emissions of the ADDF combustion mode by up to 83.5\%
               compared to the lowest unburned ammonia emissions achieved by
               single diesel injection strategy. Two split diesel injection
               strategies based on the optimum points of greenhouse gas (GHG)
               emissions are suggested in this research. At the first optimum
               point, the GHG emissions of the ADDF combustion mode are
               decreased by 23.7\%, while ITE is increased by about 2\% compared
               to the optimum point of diesel-only combustion mode. This,
               however, comes with about 10\% higher nitrogen oxides (NOx)
               emissions. The emitted GHG emissions of ADDF combustion can be
               further reduced by 30.6\%, but at the expense of 2.2\% lower ITE
               and 52.4\% higher NOx emissions than diesel-only combustion mode.
               At both optimum points, unburned ammonia emissions were
               significantly reduced to below 900 ppm compared to that of ADDF
               combustion mode with single diesel injection strategy (i.e., 4445
               ppm). The lowest unburned ammonia concentration achieved in this
               study is still above the recommended exposure limit and therefore
               the use of appropriate after-treatment devices should be
               considered in the future. © 2022",

               need to be processed under harsh and complicated experimental
               conditions. Herein, a simple fluoride-assisted hydrothermal
               method is reported for preparing highly defective and active WO3.
               The obtained WO3 shows an urchin-like morphology and a mixed
               crystal structure. The optimized sensor based on the WO3 exhibits
               a high response, excellent selectivity, and good reproducibility
               to acetone at 200 °C. More precisely, the response to 0.5 ppm
               acetone attains 3.3 and the detection limit reaches the
               ppb-level, showing a potential application in noninvasive
               diagnosis of diabetes. The unique sensing performance can be
               attributed to the dominated h-WO3 with preferential exposed (0 0
               2) facets and the increased structural defects in the synthesized
               WO3, resulting in an extent of local electric polarization on the
               surface and an easier and selective chemical adsorption to
               acetone molecules. The abundant oxygen vacancies act as
               preferential adsorption sites for absorbing oxygen species that
               can react with acetone molecules. The sensing mechanism for the
               unique sensing performance was further proved by a semi-in-situ

               pre-defined physical properties and pure colouration of one of
               the three subtractive CMY primaries (cyan, magenta or yellow).
               This contribution focuses on the development of an appropriate
               synthesis method of the yellow-hue Ni3(PO4)2 inorganic phosphate
               with the purpose to enable its application in advanced light
               reflective technologies. Polymerizable precursor method (PPM) and
               solid state reaction (SSR) were utilized for the synthesis and
               the results were evaluated with regards to phase composition,
               crystallinity, particle morphology and size distribution, surface
               area, porosity, density, optical reflectance and colour
               parameters of the product. Accordingly, PPM provides a number of
               advantages in comparison to SSR and to literature data reporting
               other inorganic yellow-shade pigments. Ni3(PO4)2 obtained by PPM
               fulfils two main demands as a subtractive primary pigment: ideal
               yellow shade and uniform spherical micron-sized particles
               morphology. Moreover, the product shows darker and saturated
               colouration, especially when taking into account the low particle
               size distribution which typically reduces colour saturation and
               increases lightness of the product. The obtained pigment with
               bright yellow colouration, that represents one of the CMY
               primaries, has a high potential for application in printing
               technologies and, after appropriate modification, in

               a narrow workable pH range, and a lack of clarity on the best
               removal mechanism hinder its application. In this work, a highly
               efficient bauxite nanocomposite (Bx-Ce-La@500) was synthesized
               via doping and pyrolysis, and its fluoride adsorption in
               industrial wastewater was examined. Doping Ce/La synergistically
               improved the fluoride adsorption affinity of the composite (from
               pHPZC 8.0 ~ 10.0) and enhanced the •OH. The materials were
               characterized by SEM-EDS, BET, XRD, and TGA while XPS, FTIR, and
               DFT were used to investigate the mechanism of fluoride sorption.
               Results show that Bx-Ce-La@ 500 has a positive zeta potential of

               phosphate ions, other ions exhibited negligible effects and the
               selective removal of F− in real wastewater was high. The main

               top CuO layer to facilitate a sensitive and selective response
               towards CO2 gas. Such a sensor architecture allowed optimum
               oxygen and CO2 gas adsorption in the interfacial region. The C/Z
               thin-film sensor exhibited a good response (47\%) for 2500 ppm
               CO2 at 375 °C as opposed to CuO (15\%) at 300 °C and ZnO (16\%)
               at 350 °C. The sensor was selective to CO2 in respect of CO and
               CH4 gases at 375 °C with selectivity factor κCO2 ∼ 5 and ∼ 8 for
               CO and CH4 respectively. By analyzing the conductance-time
               transients for the gas, the adsorption behavior of CO2 on the
               heterogenous C/Z bilayer thin-film sensor was established. CO2
               obeyed an extended Freundlich model of adsorption. Theoretical
               analysis of the said adsorption model was performed through which
               the activation energy (EA) and heat of adsorption (Q) of CO2 gas
               were estimated. A complementary relationship between EA and Q was
               established. It was shown that EA decreases with increasing
               concentration from 123.95 to 108.36 kJ/mol for 1000–2500 ppm CO2
               for energetically heterogeneous surfaces. Alternatively, Q values
               increase with increasing concentration from 59.73 to 71.65 kJ/mol
               for 500–2500 ppm CO2. The CO2 sensing mechanism was elucidated
               based on surface defects for CuO and ZnO. CO2 sensing in the C/Z
               bilayer thin-film sensor was controlled by the adsorption of
               oxygen forming a space charge layer at the surface and interface
               of the p-n heterojunction and by band-bending as a result of the
               change of electron concentration across the junction. © 2022

               (II) detection and removal from aqueous solution. Rhodamine
               moiety was conjugated with cellulose as an efficient sensor,
               enabling the material to exhibit excellent optical signals on the
               contact with Hg (II). Fourier transform infrared spectra,
               elemental analysis, thermogravimetry, differential thermal
               analysis, scanning electron microscope analysis,
               Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, pore volume and pore size
               were employed to verify the modification of cellulose. A 7-fold
               enhancement of fluorescence intensity afforded the adsorbent
               “off–on” fluorimetric response exclusively towards Hg (II)
               without the interference of more than ten other kinds of metal
               ions. The detection limit reached as low as 9.18 × 10-7 M.
               Besides, the adsorbent also showed an obvious color change during
               the adsorption to realize “naked-eye” recognition with Hg (II) in
               the range of 1–400 ppm. Thus, a colorimetric card was prepared to
               evaluate the concentration of Hg (II) in a convenient and rapid
               manner. In addition, the adsorption properties of the material
               including the effect of initial concentration, pH, and contact
               time were systematically investigated by batch adsorptions. The
               adsorption process was found to fit well with Langmuir adsorption
               model and pseudo-second-order kinetics. The mercury triggered
               spirolactam ring-opening reaction was responsible for the
               sensitive and selective fluormetric sensing and confirmed by the
               Job's plot (1:1 binding stoichiometry) and X-ray photoelectron
               spectroscopy. Furthermore, density functional theory studies also
               indicated the energetically favorable Hg (II) induced
               ring-opening process. The highly sensitive and selective
               performance in tap water further demonstrated the tremendous
               potential of as-prepared adsorbent for practical application. ©

               resulting in strong interlayer coupling and spin-orbit coupling
               effects. It is found that the hierarchical MoS2 annealed at 700

               in the organic synthesis industry. Two-dimensional Co3O4
               nanosheets with large surface areas and multiple active sites are
               ideal for fabricating chemiresistive gas sensors. However, the
               face-to-face stacking owing to the high surface energy of
               nanosheets, would cover up the active sites, obstruct gas
               diffusion, raise contact resistance, which all hinder its
               utilization for TEA detection. Herein, the Co3O4 mesoporous
               nanosheets were assembled into hierarchical microspheres by
               adding the structure-directing agent PVP K30 and combined with a
               proper annealing temperature, which optimized their grain size,
               specific surface area, pores structure, oxygen vacancies, and the

               8-hydroxyquinoline modified silica gel (HQ-SiO2) and
               2,2′-(1,4-phenylenebis(oxy)) dioctanoic acid (PPBOA) were used to
               form an efficient process for impurities removal and RE
               enrichment. Solid phase extraction successfully intercepted
               96.7\% of the radioactive element thorium. The concentration of
               aluminium was reduced to 2.14 ppm by frank chromatography. Rare
               earth elements were enriched from 336.35 mg/L to 237.75 g/L by
               extraction-precipitation, that is, the enrichment multiple
               reached more than 700 and the proportion of RE was increased from
               21.85\% to 96.62\%. The loss rate of RE was controlled below
               1.59\%. Moreover, the magnesium salt leaching solution could be

               Alloying Au with Ag gave superior thermal stability to Ag, which
               favored gas sensing performance. As the amount of Ag within the
               AgAualloy core increased, the optimum working temperature was
               lowered to 300 ℃ with the dramatically enhanced ultra-high

               the H2 sensing performances of SnO2 nanoparticles was revealed by
               varying the addition levels of thiourea and palladium chloride.
               The H2 sensing experimental results demonstrated that SnS2 and Pd

               SnO2, where 1.0 at\% Pd/SnS2/SnO2 sensor exhibited high response

               materials, and have limited applicability in difficult
               environments and harsh reservoir conditions. Synergizing
               injection water compositions in terms of salinity and ionic
               content (SmartWater) with existing recovery methods can become a
               game changer to overcome these limitations. The main objective is
               to explore the synergistic effects of SmartWater as a potential
               optimization avenue for achieving more efficient and economic EOR
               applications. To achieve this objective, a range of multiscale
               experimental data from macro- to core-scale were analyzed to
               demonstrate and quantify the benefits of water chemistry
               synergies with different recovery methods. The multiscale
               experimental data analyzed comprised of polymer rheology, contact
               angles, core floods, foam stability and rheology, besides
               evaluating the zeta potential results obtained from surface
               complexation modeling (SCM). The dilute concentrations of polymer
               ranging from 250 to 500 ppm in SmartWater increased the injection
               water viscosities by 2 to 4 times to provide better mobility
               control for light oil recovery. The tailored water chemistry
               reduced the polymer consumption requirements by one-third (from
               3000 ppm to 2000 ppm) and increased the oil recovery by 5–7\% in
               polymer flooding processes used for viscous oil recovery.
               Synergizing water chemistry with surfactant-polymer flooding
               resulted in an incremental oil recovery of about 4\% besides
               lowering the surfactant and polymer concentrations by 50\% (from
               2000 ppm to 1000 ppm). SmartWater has also been found to
               synergistically combine with carbonated waterflooding to increase
               the CO2 dissolved volumes by 25–30\% for effectively lowering the
               pH and develop favorable wettability alterations towards
               water-wet conditions. The tailored water chemistry increased the
               foam stabilities by resulting in 2–3 times higher foam half-lifes
               in addition to raising the foam apparent viscosities by 1.5
               times. SmartWater foams also increased the pressure drops in
               porous media by 50\% to confirm higher foam apparent viscosities
               and more resistance to gas flow. The benefits of different
               SmartWater based synergistic EOR technologies demonstrated in
               this study can be significant. They can deliver higher oil
               recoveries in addition to lowering the volume requirements of
               different EOR agents such as chemicals and gas. These findings
               will have a practical impact to result in more practical,

               titanate (CaTiO3) in the form of hierarchical microspheres
               synthesized using the solvothermal technique at 200 °C for 18 h.

               melt–melt immiscibility for the origin of pegmatitic melt has not

               leakage or decrepitation of these MIs during heating, external
               pressures were applied by using a hydrothermal diamond-anvil
               cell. The compositions of muscovite inside the unheated MIs and
               glass inside the MIs, which was quenched from a homogenous state,
               were analyzed using electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) and laser
               ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry
               (LA-ICP-MS). During heating, the H2O–CH4-bearing MIs were
               homogenized into an H2O-saturated melt mostly at 750–800 °C,
               while the H2O–CO2-bearing MIs, when similarly treated, showed
               H2O–CO2-oversaturated entrapment features. The H2O–CH4-bearing
               MIs are considered to be trapped from the original pegmatitic
               melt containing ∼12 wt\% H2O with up to ∼1000 ppm Li, ∼1500 ppm
               Rb, and ∼1800 ppm Cs, at pressures of ∼550–700 MPa. Based on
               previous MI-homogenization experiments, it has been reported that
               the microthermometry features and compositions (e.g., H2O
               contents) of the H2O–CH4-bearing MIs in the GMP quartz are
               similar to those in an H2O-rich melt, which was immiscible with
               an H2O-poor melt inside the heated MIs in quartz from the
               two-mica granite. Accordingly, in this study, we demonstrate that
               pegmatitic melts could be originated via melt–melt immiscibility
               of granitic magma, and that the initial exsolution of the
               pegmatitic melt from granitic magma can occur on a very small
               scale, as tiny droplets whose sizes may be similar to those of
               the observed MIs in granite. In addition to the enrichment of Li,
               B, and P, the enhanced H2O content under low oxygen fugacity
               condition in the granitic magma, as well as the decrease in
               pressure following the magma emplacement, could promote the
               melt–melt immiscibility. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",

               calyculin A/okadaic acid-insensitive Ser/Thr protein phosphatase
               that belongs to the PPM family. CaMKP is thought to be involved
               in regulation of not only various protein kinases, such as CaM
               kinases and p21-activated protein kinase, but also of cellular
               proteins regulated by phosphorylation. A large-scale screening of
               a chemical library identified gallic acid and some of its alkyl
               esters as novel CaMKP inhibitors highly specific to CaMKP.
               Surprisingly, they caused specific carbonylation of CaMKP,
               leading to its inactivation. Under the same conditions, no
               carbonylation nor inactivation was observed when PPM1A, which is
               affiliated with the same family as CaMKP, and λ-phosphatase were
               used. The carbonylation reaction was inhibited by SH compounds
               such as cysteamine in a dose-dependent manner with a concomitant
               decrease in CaMKP inhibition by ethyl gallate. The pyrogallol
               structure of gallate was necessary for the gallate-mediated
               carbonylation of CaMKP. Point mutations of CaMKP leading to
               impairment of phosphatase activity did not significantly affect
               the gallate-mediated carbonylation. Ethyl gallate resulted in
               almost complete inhibition of CaMKP under the conditions where
               the carbonylation level was nearly identical to that of CaMKP
               carbonylation via metal-catalyzed oxidation with ascorbic
               acid/FeSO4, which resulted in only a partial inhibition of CaMKP.
               The gallate-mediated carbonylation of CaMKP absolutely required
               divalent cations such as Mn2+, Cu2+, Co2+ and Fe2+, and was
               markedly enhanced by a phosphopeptide substrate. When MDA-MB-231
               cells transiently expressing CaM kinase I, a CaMKP substrate,
               were treated by ethyl gallate, significant enhancement of
               phosphorylation of CaM kinase I was observed, suggesting that
               ethyl gallate can penetrate into cells to inactivate cellular
               CaMKP. All the presented data strongly support the hypothesis
               that CaMKP undergoes carbonylation of its specific amino acid
               residues by incubation with alkyl gallates and the divalent metal
               cations, leading to inactivation specific to CaMKP. © 2022

               influence on ARB inactivation with prolonged bactericidal time
               from 60 to 160 min. Addition of TET in environmental

               the release kinetics and antimicrobial property of ClO2.
               Solutions made with weak acids released ClO2 more slowly and had
               higher stability than those made with hydrochloric acid.
               Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Listeria
               monocytogenes were treated with 1, 2.5, and 5 ppm ClO2 for 3 or 5
               min. Lettuce inoculated with the pathogenic bacteria were treated
               with 2.5 and 5 ppm ClO2 for 5 min. The effects of peptone load at
               0.01\% and 0.02\% on the antimicrobial efficacy of ClO2 were
               investigated in S. Typhimurium cell suspensions. The contribution
               of acids alone at the pH of the ClO2 solutions to bacterial
               reduction was also evaluated. The 2.5 ppm ClO2 solutions made
               with citric acid, lactic acid, and malic acid showed higher
               reductions in all three bacteria than ClO2 made with hydrochloric
               acid and sodium bisulfate. The 5 ppm ClO2 solutions produced with
               organic acids reduced populations of all bacterial strains from 7
               log CFU/mL to undetectable level in 3 min, except S. Typhimurium
               treated by ClO2 produced with lactic acid. On inoculated Romaine
               lettuce model, 5 ppm ClO2 produced with lactic acid and malic
               acid resulted in the highest reduction of E. coli O157:H7, S.
               Typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes of approximately 1.4, 1.7, and
               2.4 log CFU/g, respectively. The antimicrobial efficacy of ClO2
               made with HCl and NaHSO4 were affected by 0.01\% and 0.02\%
               peptone load, respectively. Food-grade organic acids produced
               aqueous ClO2 solutions with stronger antimicrobial properties
               than inorganic acids. The acids alone at the pH of ClO2 did not

               its ability to remove mercury from water. To enhance its
               properties, cyanoguanidine was utilized as the modifier to
               synthesize the poly-cyanoguanidine/graphene oxide composite
               (DCDA-GO) through chlorination and cyanidation reaction, and the
               infrared spectrum and elemental analysis proved a successful
               synthesis. The prepared material has discovered a tremella-like
               three-dimensional structure with surface ravines, which achieved
               the actual maximum Hg(II) adsorption capacity to be 174.7 mg g−1
               at 200 mg L−1. The DCDA-GO demonstrated a high pH-tolerance
               property and high removal efficiency at the wider pH (>91.5\%,
               1–13) and high resistance of ionic strength (>92.86\%, 2000 mg
               L−1). Meanwhile, DCDA-GO can also complete the selective
               enrichment of Hg(II) in the bi-component and multi-component
               solution containing seven different metal ions, whose selectivity
               coefficient to Hg(II) was 1.7 × 105 mL g−1 and 3–5 orders of
               magnitude higher than other metal ions except for lead. And the
               composite can keep a high removal efficiency (85.5\%) after 4
               cycles. The adsorption process reached equilibrium after 100 min,
               which can be described as an endothermic, multilayer, and
               chemical interaction. The proposed adsorption mechanism was
               primarily ascribed to the chelation between Hg(II) and
               nitrogen-containing groups (imino and nitrile groups) while the
               contribution from electrostatic attraction was neglectable due to
               a positively charged surface. Moreover, the Hg(II) concentration
               was dramatically declined from 20 ppm to 1 ppb after column
               adsorption, the capacity could reach 108.17 mg g−1. On the whole,
               the DCDA-GO could be the remarkable material for removing Hg(II)

               materials is extensively studied in the past. But, the disposal
               of the resulting Hg(II) adsorbed materials is the major concern.
               Herein, a simple and novel sustainable strategy is introduced to
               remediate Hg(II) as Hg(0) with the help of graphene quantum dots
               (GQDs) coated carbon cloth (CC) and utilize the formed Hg(0) as
               an sensor for nitrobenzene (NB). When GQDs coated CC (CC/GQDs)
               was contacted with Hg(II) of different concentration it was
               converted into Hg(0), which is confirmed by TEM and SEM. The
               reduction of Hg(II) to Hg(0) by CC/GQDs is further confirmed from
               the XPS spectrum obtained for Hg 4 f region at binding energies
               of 100 and 104 eV besides differential pulse voltammetry (DPV).

               show 3-fold higher removal efficiency than CC/GQDs. Finally, the

               leaching, known as ‘in-situ recovery’ (ISR). ISR involves the
               injection of an acid fluid into ore-bearing aquifers and the
               pumping of the resulting metal-containing solution through cation
               exchange columns for the recovery of dissolved U. Rehabilitation
               of ISR-impacted aquifers could be achieved through natural
               attenuation, or via biostimulation of autochthonous heterotrophic
               microorganisms due to the associated acid neutralization and
               trace metal immobilization. In this study, we analyzed the
               capacity of pristine aquifer sediments impacted by diluted ISR
               fluids to buffer pH and immobilize U. The experimental setup
               consisted of glass columns, filled with sediment from a U
               ore-bearing aquifer, through which diluted ISR fluids were flowed
               continuously. The ISR solution was obtained from ISR mining
               operations at the Muyunkum and Tortkuduk deposits in Kazakhstan.
               Following this initial phase, columns were biostimulated with a
               mix of molasses, yeast extract and glycerol to stimulate the
               growth of autochthonous heterotrophic communities. Experimental
               results showed that this amendment efficiently promoted the
               activity of acid-tolerant bacterial guilds, with pH values rising
               from 4.8 to 6.5–7.0 at the outlet of the stimulated columns. The
               reduction of sulfate, nitrate, and metals as well as
               dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia induced the rise in pH
               values, in agreement with geochemical modelling results.
               Biostimulation efficiently promoted the complete immobilization
               of U, with the accumulation of up to 3343 ppm in the first few
               centimeters of the columns. Synchrotron analysis and SEM-EDS
               revealed that up to 60\% of the injected hexavalent U was
               immobilized as tetravalent non-crystalline U onto bacterial cell
               surfaces. 16S rDNA amplicon analysis and qPCR data suggested a
               predominant role played for members of the Phylum Firmicutes

  abstract  = "A twin surface dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) ignited in a
               dry synthetic air gas stream is studied regarding the formation
               of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and their impact
               on the conversion of admixed n-butane. The discharge is driven by
               a damped sinusoidal voltage waveform at peak-to-peak amplitudes
               of 8 kVpp-13 kVpp and pulse repetition frequencies of 250 Hz-4000
               Hz. Absolute densities of O3, NO2, NO3, as well as estimates of
               the sum of the densities of N2O4 and N2O5 are determined
               temporally resolved by means of optical absorption spectroscopy
               using a laser driven broadband light source, suitable
               interference filters, and a photodiode detector. The measured
               densities are acquired across the center of the reactor chamber
               as well as at the outlet of the chamber. The temporal and spatial
               evolution of the species' densities is correlated to the
               conversion of n-butane at concentrations of 50 ppm and 400 ppm,
               measured by means of flame ionization detectors. The n-butane is
               admixed either before or after the reactor chamber, in order to
               separate the impact of short- and long-lived reactive species on
               the conversion process. It is found that, despite the stationary
               conversion at the selected operating points, at higher voltages
               and repetition frequencies the densities of the measured species
               are not in steady state. Based on the produced results it is
               presumed that the presence of n-butane modifies the formation and
               consumption pathways of O3. At the same time, there is no
               significant impact on the formation of dinitrogen oxides (N2O4
               and N2O5). Furthermore, a comparatively high conversion of
               n-butane, when admixed at the outlet of the reactor chamber is
               observed. These findings are discussed together with known rate
               coefficients for the reactions of n-butane with selected RONS. ©

               to investigate the response of leaf gas exchange and plant growth
               of two C4 species representing both dicot (amaranth) and monocot
               (maize) to progressive drought under two different [CO2] (ambient
               (a[CO2], 400 ppm) and elevated (e[CO2], 800 ppm)). The soil water
               status in the pots was expressed as the fraction of transpirable
               soil water (FTSW). The results showed that as compared to a[CO2],
               e[CO2] significantly increased net photosynthetic rate (An) at
               non-stress condition (An max) for both species, while the
               increase was more pronounced in maize than in amaranth. Stomatal
               conductance (gs) at non-stress condition was significantly lower
               at e[CO2] in both species. The FTSW threshold, at which An starts
               to decrease, was higher in maize grown at e[CO2] than at a[CO2],
               whereas it was not affected in amaranth. In both species, gs
               decreased at higher FTSW threshold when grown at e[CO2] than at
               a[CO2]. e[CO2] decreased stomatal density (SD) in amaranth but
               increased it in maize; drought increased SD in amaranth but not
               in maize. Intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) was significantly
               enhanced by e[CO2] and drought stress at FTSW ranged from 0.0 to
               0.6, particularly in maize. e[CO2] increased leaf area of
               well-watered plants in maize and decreased specific leaf area in
               amaranth. In amaranth, water consumption of well-watered plants
               was increased and plant WUE was decreased at e[CO2]. The varied
               responses of leaf gas exchange and WUE to soil water deficits and
               e[CO2] among the two C4 species imply their different mechanisms
               in stomatal control over carbon gain versus water loss in dicot
               and monocot plants, which is essentially important for selecting
               crop species and developing strategies to optimize crop WUE in a

               annealing treatment. SEM, TEM, XRD and other morphological
               characterization methods were used to detect the composites.
               Through the analysis of the characterization results, it can be
               found that the special structure of heterojunction is a
               three-dimensional structure which composed of ZnO hexagonal
               nanosheets and surface attached In2O3 nanoparticles, with a
               specific surface area of 63.27 m2/g. Measurements show that
               diameter of the nanosheets is 200–300 nm, the thickness is 40–60
               nm, and the particle size of In2O3 nanoparticle is 30–60 nm. Due
               to the unique hexagonal three-dimensional structure, large
               specific surface area and rich mesoporous structure, gas sensing
               test results of the sensor prepared through ZnO@In2O3
               heterojunction present that response value to 100 ppm ethanol at
               160 °C is 28.6, which is much higher than pure ZnO and In2O3; It
               also presents the ability of rapid ethanol detection (response
               and recovery time are 8 s and 17 s); The synthesis of unique
               heterojunction structure greatly improves the sensitivity to
               ethanol, lower operating temperature significantly reduces energy
               consumption, and the repeatability and stability of sensors also
               perform excellent. Above advantages confirm that ZnO@In2O3

               the perspective of P acquisition capability via root
               proliferation and mediating biochemical properties in the
               rhizosphere to access various soil P fractions. It is
               particularly important in cropping soils where P fertilizer plus
               soil P is required to synchronize crop P demand for the
               production sustainability under climate change. However, few
               studies have examined the effect of CO2 and temperature
               co-elevation on plant P acquisition, P fractions and relevant
               functional genes in the rhizosphere of different crops. Thus, the
               present study investigated the effect of elevated CO2 and warming
               on P uptake of soybean and rice grown in Mollisols, and soil P
               fractions and relevant biochemical properties and microbial
               functions in the rhizosphere with or without P application.
               Open-top chambers were used to achieve elevated CO2 of 700 ppm
               combined with warming (+ 2 °C above ambient temperature). CO2 and
               temperature co-elevation increased P uptake in soybean by 23\%
               and 28\% under the no-P and P application treatments,
               respectively; and in rice, by 34\% and 13\%, respectively. CO2
               and temperature co-elevation depleted organic P in the
               rhizosphere of soybean, but increased in the rhizosphere of rice.
               The phosphatase activity negatively correlated with organic P in
               the highland soil while positively in the paddy soil. The P
               mineralization likely occurs in soybean-grown soils under climate
               change, while the P immobilization in paddy soils. CO2 and
               temperature co-elevation increased the copy numbers of P
               functional genes including phoD, phoC, pstS and phnX, in soils
               with P application. These results indicate that the P application
               would be requested to satisfy the increased P demand in soybean
               under climate change, but not in rice in paddy soils where soil P
               availability is sufficient. Therefore, elevated CO2 and
               temperature facilitated the crop P uptake via biochemical and
               microbial pathways, and P functional genes played an essential
               role in the conversion of P. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",

               and the element abundance of Mo (about 1.1–1.5 ppm) and Re (about
               0.0004–0.0026 ppm) is tremendous in the continental crust. These
               congenital characteristics make it difficult to separate Mo and
               Re. In this work, the Mo and Re resource features and products
               consumption are briefly summarized, and the pre-separation of Mo
               and Re from minerals or secondary alloy scraps, and the deep
               separation of the dissolved Mo and Re from solutions are
               systematically reviewed. Pyrometallurgy approaches are suitable
               for the treatment of high-grade Mo concentrates, however it lacks
               vast energy consumption and SO2 emission. Hydrometallurgical
               process is appropriate to deal with low-grade Mo concentrates,
               but leaching efficiency of Mo is low and numerous expensive
               oxidants are consumed. As for deep separation of Mo and Re from
               the solutions, selective chemical precipitation, ion exchange,
               and solvent extraction are commonly used in industry to separate
               Mo and Re. Due to separation efficiency, Mo and Re mixture
               solutions with low concentrations generally lower than 0.5 g/L
               are concomitantly generated after ion exchange and solvent
               extraction. Selective adsorption is a prospective method to
               separate Mo and Re from ultra-low concentration solutions, while
               the existing preparation technologies of high-selectivity
               adsorbents are characterized as complex and expensive. Developing
               facile and low-cost preparation of adsorbents is a promising
               research orientation for clean and deep separation of Mo and Re
               from solutions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",

               equivalent boron content for the graphite reflectors of the ASTRA
               facility reported in the benchmark specifications was estimated
               using the results of the exponential experiments performed by
               graphite manufacturer. Because raw measured data are not
               available for these experiments, we tried to reassess the
               equivalent boron content for the ASTRA graphite reflectors using
               the results of analogous exponential experiments performed
               earlier on the empty RBMK critical facility at the National
               Research Center «Kurchatov Institute» and further simulation of
               the experiments utilizing the Monte Carlo code Serpent with
               ENDF/B-VII.0, ENDF/B-VII.1, and ENDF/B-VIII.0 cross-section

               graphite blocks for the RBMK critical facility and the ASTRA
               critical facility. The Monte Carlo simulations confirmed the
               accuracy of the exponential measurements performed for RBMK
               graphite characterization. It was also shown that the simulation
               must reproduce the graphite absorption cross-section estimated
               using the exponential experiments for the agreement between the
               measured and calculated distribution of thermal neutron flux.
               Therefore, the equivalent boron content should be assessed
               individually for each cross-section library used in the
               simulation. In case of the ASTRA facility the carbon capture
               cross section of 3.36 mb at 0.0253 eV (ENDF/B-VII.0) was used to
               deduce the equivalent boron content of 1 ppm wt from the measured
               results. Thermal capture cross-section of carbon was
               significantly increased in the ENDF/B-VII.1 and other recent
               cross-section libraries. Therefore, when calculating the ASTRA
               benchmark with these cross-section libraries the equivalent boron

               fuel gas composition on the HCl removal performance of the
               prepared absorbent was studied. It was found that the removal
               performance in an inert atmosphere was maintained in the presence
               of H2. On the other hand, the performance deteriorated in the
               presence of CO due to carbon deposition from the
               disproportionation reaction of CO. When CO2 was added to the CO,
               carbon deposition was suppressed in the air-blown gas and the HCl
               removal performance recovered. The performance recovery for an
               oxygen-blown gas was smaller than that for an air-blown gas.
               However, when the amount of CO2 added to the oxygen-blown gas was
               increased, the removal performance improved. The HCl removal
               performance of the absorbent was dependent on the initial HCl

               light-harvesting self-powered sensors can significantly
               contribute to the sustainable development of human civilization.
               In this paper we propose a light-harvesting self-powered
               mechanical sensing concept with a simple monolithic structure. We
               successfully demonstrate the excellent operation of our sensors
               under different photoexcitation conditions from natural to
               artificial lights and from weak to strong light powers. Under
               illumination of a commercial light emitting diode (LED) with a
               power of 46 µW, the generated lateral photovoltage is of 3.07 mV,
               which increases by 6, 13, and 20 µV under applied strains of 225,
               450, and 675 ppm, respectively. Upon the increase of the light
               power to 428 µW, the lateral photovoltage reaches 16.42 mV under
               the free-strain condition, and increases by 11, 25, and 45 µV
               under the same strain conditions. In addition, even under room
               light, the lateral photovoltages are 0.86 mV, 0.86 mV + 4.2 µV,
               0.86 mV + 8.0 µV, and 0.86 mV + 11.5 µV under strains of 0, 225,
               450, and 675 ppm, respectively. Interestingly, the sensitivity of
               the sensor increases from 0.017 µV/ppm under ambient lighting to
               0.03 and 0.065 µV/ppm under LED light powers of 46 µW and 428 µW,
               respectively. These promising results indicate that sensitivity
               of the self-powered strain sensor can be readily tuned by
               controlling illumination. The work offers a promising
               concept-of-proof methodology for the development of self-powered

               impregnating KOH on rice husk-based KOH activated carbon (KOH-AC,
               1439 m2/g). KOH can be successfully loaded on the surface of
               KOH-AC and significantly changed its surface properties. DKOH-AC
               still remained a considerable surface area (206 m2/g) and showed
               a similar Smicro/SBET ratio. In-situ FTIR analysis confirmed that
               the major CO2 adsorption mechanism of KOH-AC was based on
               physisorption while that on DKOH-AC involved both chemisorption
               and physisorption. DKOH-AC showed a higher heat of adsorption (34
               ∼ 41 KJ/mol) and gas selectivity (16.6) than these of KOH-AC.
               KOH-AC quickly reached an adsorption equilibrium (about 50 min)
               as compared to that of DKOH-AC. In addition, DKOH-AC exhibited an

               concentration of CO2 (2000 ppm ∼ 500 ppm) under indoor
               conditions. Both the CO2 adsorption isotherm on KOH-AC and
               DKOH-AC well followed the Langmuir and Freundlich models. The CO2
               adsorption kinetics on KOH-AC followed the pseudo-first order
               model whereas that on DKOH-AC obeyed the pseudo-second order
               model. The adsorption process was controlled by the intraparticle

               studied in the degradation of diclofenac in aqueous medium (50

               properties of Al-Ga-xAg reveals the presence of highly dispersed

               recombination rate of photo-induced electron-hole pairs of

               γ-Al2O3 photo-converts 66.0\% of diclofenac after 20 min of

               photodegradation reaction kinetics were adjusted well to a
               first-order Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction kinetics. The
               improvement in the photocatalytic activity of coupled Al-Ga-xAg
               composites could be due to that highly dispersed Ag0
               nanoparticles and Ag+ ions act as electron (e−) traps, whereas
               Al-Ga mixed oxide acts as hole (h+) traps, promoting the decrease
               in the recombination rate of photo-induced electron-hole pairs.
               Transient photocurrent response experiments confirm that the
               silver species effectively increase efficiently the separation of
               photo-generated (e−, h+) charges. Experiments of diclofenac
               photodegradation with addition of scavengers indicates that h+

  abstract  = "Photocatalytic treatment of wastewater using nanomaterials is an
               efficient energy saving technology. Yet the practical application
               of the technology is limited because of difficulty in developing
               the stable, supported photocatalytic nanoparticles that can be
               used under continuous flow conditions. Here, we report an
               efficient removal of glyphosate (GLP) and Cr(VI) from water under
               batch as well as continuous flow conditions using the activated
               carbon fiber (ACF)-supported nanocomposite of CoNiWO4 (CNW) and
               g-C3N4 (gCN), as a photocatalyst. CNW-gCN/ACF is synthesized
               using a one-step strategy, and spectroscopic characterization
               techniques are used to corroborate the formation of the
               Z-scheme-based CNW-gCN heterojunction in the ACF substrate.
               Efficacy of the photocatalyst is assessed in visible light
               irradiation. The batch activity data of the individual pollutant
               show the complete oxidation of GLP at 30 ppm and reduction of
               Cr(VI) at 200 ppm concentration levels in 60 and 150 min,
               respectively at 1 g/L dose of CNW-gCN/ACF. Photocatalytic
               efficiency of CNW-gCN/ACF in the simultaneous removal of both
               pollutants from co-contaminated feed is found to be greater than
               that in single-feed system under identical experimental
               conditions. Tested under flow conditions, CNW-gCN/ACF shows
               approximately the same rates of oxidation and reduction as
               prevalent under batch conditions, indicating the efficient
               immobilization of the nanocatalyst particles in ACF, which not
               only prevents elution of the catalyst but also improves its
               reusability. The toxicity data indicate the treated water samples
               to be non-toxic. The current study provides an efficient method
               for developing supported nanomaterial photocatalysts for treating

               predicting the stability and performance of specific mGT

               Simulations (LES) is presented in this paper. Results show that

               Although the flow dynamics are identical, diluted operating
               conditions lead to a wider reaction zone. An outlet temperature
               reduction could be observed in the water diluted cases due to the

               method was added to the acidic solution at different optimized
               concentrations of 25, 100, 300, 500, and 700 ppm and were
               characterized. Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR), X-ray
               diffractometer (XRD), and scanning electron microscope equipped
               with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) were used to study
               the bonding, phase formation, morphology, and elemental
               composition of the polymeric surface, while gravimetric analysis
               techniques were used to determine the corrosion rate. The C–H
               functional group dominance in the FTIR spectra indicated adequate

               and crystalline structures because of different characteristics

               compositions. It, however, displayed the maximum inhibition

               that atmospheric signals from low-mass, temperate exoplanets are
               being increasingly studied. The signal acquired as the planet
               transits its host star, known as the transit depth, is smaller
               for these planets and, as such, more difficult to analyze. The
               launch of the space telescopes James Webb (JWST) \& Ariel will
               give rise to an explosion in the quality and quantity of
               spectroscopic data available for an unprecedented number of
               exoplanets in our galaxy. Accurately extracting the information
               content, thereby permitting atmospheric science, of such
               data-sets will require robust models and techniques. We present
               here the analysis of simulated transmission spectra for
               water-rich atmospheres, giving evidence for non-negligible
               differences in simulated transit depths when self-broadening of
               H2O is correctly accounted for, compared with the currently
               typically accepted standard of using H2 and He-broadened

               detectable with JWST and Ariel. The differences are most

               nanospheres with high specific surface area (46.8 m2·g−1) and
               large pore size (12.9 nm) are synthesized and used as a

               self-template strategy is developed for the spherical mesoporous
               sensing materials using Au-Zn-polyphenol hybrids as a precursor.
               The mesoporous Au-ZnO nanosphere-based gas sensor shows high
               response of 52.6 towards 10 ppm of TMA at 250 °C. The response is
               43 times more than that for mesoporous ZnO spheres without Au
               modification. The response time is 12 s. The mesoporous Au-ZnO

               synthesized via a post-modification method. The high sensing

               Hemicelluloses were cationized by etherification reaction in

               increase of the methyl group band (1475 cm−1), supported by
               theoretical analysis. CH elemental analysis showed 1.92\% (±0.09)
               of nitrogen and degree of substitution (DS) of 0.32 (±0.01).
               Turbidity, apparent color, TSS, COD and BOD5.20 was performed in
               a jartest with coagulation pH (5–11) and dosages range (100–900

               printed ion gel as the dielectric layer. The as-prepared TFTs
               exhibited an extremely high sensitivity to H2S (up to 1565\%
               ppm-1) at room temperature (25 ℃) and the relative humidity (RH)

               The outstanding improvement of sensor characteristics was related
               to the enrichment and absorption of H2S by ionic liquids, and the

               increase the effectiveness of this natural product in the control
               of Ae. aegypti larvae. In this study, we evaluated the
               effectiveness of piperine loaded or not into two nanostructured
               systems (named NS-A and NS-B) prepared by the nanoprecipitation
               method. The Ae. aegypti larvae were exposed to different
               concentrations of piperine loaded or not (2 to 16 ppm) and the
               mortality was investigated after 24, 48, and 72 hours. The
               nanostructures prepared were spherical in shape with narrow size
               distribution and great encapsulation efficiency. The lethal
               concentration 50 (LC50) for non-loaded piperine were 13.015 ppm
               (24 hours), 8.098 ppm (48 hours), and 7.248 ppm (72 hours). The
               LC50 values found for NS-A were 35.378 ppm (24 hours), 12.091 ppm
               (48 hours), and 8.011 ppm (72 hours), whereas the values found
               for NS-B were 21.267 ppm (24 hours), 12.091 ppm (48 hours), and
               8.011 ppm (72 hours). Collectively, these findings suggested that
               non-loaded piperine caused higher larval mortality in the first
               hours of exposure while the nanostructured systems promoted the
               slow release of piperine and thereby increased the larvicidal
               activity over time. Therefore, loading piperine into
               nanostructured systems might be an effective tool to improve the
               larval control of vector Ae. aegypti. © 2022",

               (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning

               treated with chlorosulfonic acid to induce sulfonic acid (SO3H)

               exhibit increased proton conductivity due to the presence of
               well-dispersed MS and surface functional –SO3H groups. A peak

               scavenging and mosquitocidal activity of PG in the laboratory
               condition. Methods: The existence of chemical compounds in the PG
               were studied by GC–MS analysis. Free radicals scavenging activity
               of PG was studied by using various invitro assays. Mosquitocidal
               efficacy of PG was studied by the experiment on larvicidal,
               pupicidal, adulticidal, fecundity, longevity, and ovicidal
               activity against An. stephensi, Ae. aegypti and Cx.
               quinquefasciatus. Results: GC–MS analysis revealed fifteen
               chemical compounds present in the PG. Free radical scavenging was
               done by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, 2,2′-azino-bis
               (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid), hydroxyl, and

               and 38 μg/mL respectively. PG exhibited better larvae and pupae
               mortality against I-IV instar of Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50:
               148.765, 162.534, 187.619, 210.835 and 234.624 ppm, LC90:
               286.636, 306.390, 350.276, 390.735 and 419.195 ppm). The highest

               with the IC50 and IC90 values of 128.114 and 260.609 ppm. An.
               stephensi showed highly decreased fecundity and longevity even at
               a low concentration of PG. Inhibition of 100\% egg hatchability
               of An. stephensi was obtained at 250 ppm followed by Ae. aegypti,

               The results provide the first proof that PG could be a successful
               natural agent for controlling different mosquito vectors.

               Debromination and reuse of Br-containing PS plastics is a
               critical technical challenge. Here, we demonstrate a method for
               combining alkaline hydrothermal debromination and co-blending

               9340 mg/kg, with a removal efficiency of 84.95\% at least. Then,
               we co-blended the debromination PS products (1 part) with
               qualified normal PS plastics (9 parts) for granulation. Compared
               to the qualified normal PS, the physical properties of the
               co-blended plastics remained stable in terms of the melt index,
               tensile strength, flexural strength andflexural modulus, which
               made it have good application prospects. Meanwhile, the Br

               applicability of gold nanoparticles (GNPs). One commonly used
               approach for formulation of functionalized GNPs involves the
               synthesis of Citrate-capped GNPs followed by replacement of the
               citrate molecules by a functional ligand. Using a similar method,
               we demonstrate the synthesis of L-serine functionalized Tween-20
               stabilized Citrate-GNPs. Tween-20 stabilization was essential to
               maintain the colloidal stability of the GNPs during further
               functionalization. The minimum concentration of Tween-20 for
               effective stabilization was found to be 1.88 mg mL−1. It was
               found that adsorption of Tween-20 on Citrate-GNPs improved their
               colloidal stability due to which it resisted NaCl-mediated
               destabilization well up to 1 M NaCl. Interestingly, further
               functionalization with L-serine reduced the GNP stability mildly,
               and made the dispersion more susceptible to destabilization using
               1 M NaCl. The size and morphology of the GNPs were characterized
               using TEM and DLS analysis. UV-Visible spectroscopy and optical
               images were used to examine the colloidal stability of the
               dispersions. We further tested the interaction of GNPs with nine
               different bivalent heavy metal cations. L-serine functionalized
               GNPs were found to have remarkable specificity towards lead
               (Pb2+) ions. The interaction was visible as a shift in the
               surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak from the original 524 nm of
               GNPs to 660 nm displaying aggregated particles. The GNPs
               displayed colorimetric sensing of Pb2+ in the concentration range
               up to 50 ppm, which was visible to the naked eye as gradual
               change in GNP colour from pink, purple, violet and blue
               concurrently with progressively increasing Pb2+ concentrations.
               The L-serine functionalized GNPs have immense potential to be
               developed as a cost-effective, simple and rapid assay for
               detection of Pb2+ ions in contaminated water samples. © 2022

               successfully synthesized and acted as photoanode and cathode,
               respectively, the as-prepared photocatalytic fuel cell. After
               MoS2 is modified, the modified composite photoanode obtains
               higher light-harvesting, electron-hole separation efficiency and
               electron transport efficiency than pure TiO2 nanorod photoanode.
               The result indicated that the photocurrent of the MT-3 photoanode
               is 1.76 times higher than that of pure TiO2. The enhanced
               performance is attributed to the formation of heterojunction
               between TiO2 and MoS2 in reducing the interface charge carrier
               recombination and improving the light-harvesting compared with
               bare TiO2. The highest value of open-circuit voltage (0.7 V),

               The degradation performance of the proposed PFC system was
               evaluated by decomposing the model organic pollutants. As the

               growth and toxicity of a toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum

               growth of A. minutum compared to the group (400 ppm) representing
               the current CO2 level. The total yields of PSTs by A. minutum,
               including both intracellular and extracellular toxins, were
               significantly enhanced, probably due to the induction of core
               enzyme activity and key amino acids synthesis for PST production.
               More interestingly, high level of CO2 promoted the transformation
               from gonyautoxin2\&3 to gonyautoxin1\&4 and depressed the release
               of PSTs from inside to outside of the cells. All these processes

               of contaminants such as PFAS using foam fractionation, dewatering
               of gas wells and particle cleanout in pipelines. These
               applications usually involve dissolved salts and solid
               particulates, which may have a positive or adverse impact on the
               foam flow and its performance depending on the application, the
               system's constituents (e.g., type and concentration of
               salt/particles) and the operating condition (e.g., gas and liquid
               flowrates). This work aims to investigate the effect of salts
               (primarily NaCl) up to 0.2 M salt and solid particulates (mainly
               clay) up to 25 g/L particles on the dynamic behaviour of 200 ppm
               sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) foam flows, frictional and
               hydrostatic pressure gradient, foam holdup and flow regimes in a
               vertical column. Flow regimes are analysed through power spectral
               density (PSD) and the probability density function of
               differential pressure data. The results show that salt and
               particles affect the foaming performance of SDBS solutions, thus
               influencing the transition of flow regimes. Our static tests show
               a 1.2-to-2.2-fold increase in the effect of salts and particles
               on the foamability of the SDBS solutions, whereas the foam flow
               dynamic data show a strong dependence on the hydrodynamics of the
               system. For example, the pressure gradient of the foam flow
               experienced a 16\% reduction with the addition of salt and
               particles at low gas superficial velocity (Vsg of 0.48–2.4 m/s
               and fixed Vsl of 0.02 m/s) due to the domination of gravitational
               dP/dz while it increased up to 22\% at high Vsg of up to 11.2 m/s
               due to the domination of frictional forces. Our results
               demonstrate that the foam static properties such as foamability,
               foam stability and wetness are useful to understand the
               stabilising mechanisms of foams. However, they cannot represent

               patients. Using a facile hydrothermal method, pristine ZnO and
               ZnSe were prepared, and then they were mixed and thermally
               annealed to form the composite. Subsequently, the materials were
               characterized by using various techniques such as XRD, XPS, EPR,
               etc. According to the sensing study, the highest response of the
               material in 1 ppm acetone was as high as 5.8, which was 2.3 times
               that of pure ZnO. In addition, the as-prepared composite was less
               sensitive to interfering gases, which indicates the feasibility
               of developing highly sensitive acetone sensors based on this
               material. Thus, the material prepared in this work may be applied
               to the non-invasive detection of diabetes in patients, and hence
               it is worthy to conduct further in-depth research. © 2022

               inclusions and some Al2O3–TixOy and Al2O3(–TixOy)–titanium
               nitride (TiN) composite inclusions in the nickel-based alloy with
               initial deoxidants of 0.3–0.7\% Al and 0.7–1.2\% Ti (wt\%). The
               total Ti content in the inclusions increased slightly with an
               increasing amount of added Ti. Thermodynamic calculations were
               conducted to understand the formation mechanism of the inclusions
               and control the inclusions. The predominance diagram obtained for
               the Al–Ti–O inclusions in the nickel-based superalloy system was
               based on Factsage and classical thermodynamic calculations. The
               inclusions obtained from experiments were not completely
               consistent with the Factsage calculated results; however, they
               agreed well with the classical thermodynamic calculation. The

               inclusion was Al2O3 in liquid K4169 alloy at 1823 K. The oxygen

               Al2O3 inclusions in the superalloy. Thermodynamic results
               indicated the initial precipitation of TiN in the FCC phase of

               of TiN decreased with the decrease of N content and increase in
               Ti content in the superalloy. The precipitation of TiN was not

               augmented sensitivity, quick response-recovery rates and improved
               selectivity still present significant scientific challenges. The
               continuing interest in the design of such materials is driven by
               the increased emission of toxic gases in the industrial processes
               that result in detrimental threats to public health and
               environmental sustainability. Thus, the realisation in
               fabricating these materials for functional spin-based information
               processing devices remains indefinable due to numerous
               fundamental challenges. Consequently, in this work, we report on
               the room temperature chemiresistive gas sensing and
               ferromagnetism active structure based on the designed
               heterostructured CeO2-SnO2 nano-oxide interface. We elucidate
               that the optimised sensing material (CeO2-SnO2-300 °C), annealing
               at 300 °C, can detect ammonia (NH3) gas at low concentration
               (parts-per-million, ppm) levels with rapid response-recovery
               times and improved sensitivity. The excellent selectivity towards
               NH3 amongst other gases, such as CO, CH4, H2, H2S, ethanol and
               NO2, ensures adequate safety in detecting NH3 hazards. Based on
               the NH3 sensing characteristics, the tentative sensing mechanism
               was postulated. Moreover, the well-defined room temperature
               ferromagnetism (RTFM) was observed for mixed CeO2-SnO2-300
               nano-oxide. The enhanced gas sensing response and RTFM were
               attributed to the concomitant structural improvements resulting
               from the high surface area, the relative concentration of oxygen
               vacancies and Ce3+ ions at the surface of CeO2 for the
               CeO2-SnO2-300 °C sample. These findings provide additional

               an ultrasensitive and quantitative detection of trace Hg2+,
               relying on an urchin-like architecture of Cu@carbon nanoneedles

               behavior by using it in a compression ignition (CI) engine. For
               extraction, pyrolysis process was adopted and temperature was
               maintained at 240–360 °C. Fuel property testing was done on the
               resultant oil collected. It was then blended with diesel in the

               for gas sensing due to their excellent chemical stability and

               of ingenious design strategies to achieve customizable gas
               detection in complex environments. Herein, a novel and scalable
               strategy of constructing organic-inorganic “chelate” adsorption
               sites is proposed to promote the affinity of MOS sensing
               materials to target molecules. Specifically,
               3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES)-functionalized reduced
               graphene oxide (rGO) was decorated on In2O3 tubes (AG/Inx), and
               its NO2 sensing performance was studied. As a result, the optimal
               AG/Inx shows boosted room-temperature NO2 response, and its
               response to 1 ppm NO2 is 4.8 times that of In2O3. More
               attractively, the optimal AG/Inx exhibits good selectivity, as
               well as outstanding detection ability (Rg/Ra = 1.6) for low
               concentration NO2 (20 ppb). Experimental results suggest that
               APTES-rGO not only acts as the electron acceptor to accelerate
               charge transfer, but also enhances NO2 adsorption. Further
               theoretical calculations reveal that NO2 is simultaneously
               adsorbed at rGO and APTES via a flexible “chelate” mechanism. The
               multidentate adsorption configuration remarkably strengthens the
               NO2-host interaction, which is conducive to improving sensing

               until maturity in heavy metals polluted soils from the Rhine

               regular temperature) during the critical growth period in
               controlled environmental chambers. Different morpho-physiological
               parameters, heavy metal concentration in aerial organs, seed
               quality parameters, and toxicological index were recorded. The
               results showed that no morphological differences were observed
               related to CO2. Moreover, Alim 3.14 showed the highest yield
               under control conditions, but it was more sensitive to climatic
               conditions than the German cultivars, especially to heat stress
               which strongly reduces the biomass of the fruits. Heavy metals
               concentration in soil exceeds the legislation limits for
               agricultural soils for Cd and Pb, with 1.6 and 487 mg kg−1
               respectively. In all cultivars, soybeans accumulated Cd in its
               aerial organs, and it could be translocated to fruits. Cd
               concentration in seeds ranged between 0.6 and 2.4 mg kg−1, which
               exceed legislation limits and with toxicological risk to
               potential Chinese consumers. Pb levels were lower than Cd in
               seeds (0.03–0.17 mg kg−1), and the accumulation were concentrated
               in the vegetative organs, with 93\% of the Pb incorporated.
               Moreover, pods accumulated 11 times more Pb than seeds, which
               suggests that they act as a barrier to the passage of Pb to their
               offspring. These results evidence that soybean can easily
               translocate Cd, but not Pb, to reproductive organs. No regular

               challenging. In this work, biomorphic In2O3 sensing material
               (In2O3-600) was successfully prepared through simple indium
               chloride solution immersion and air calcination at 600 ℃ with

               cross-linked by uniform spherical nanoparticles with good

               are conducive to promoting the rapid diffusion and desorption of

               that would ensure sterility and, simultaneously, preserve the
               filtering properties of the materials. In addition, the reuse of
               PPEs by reprocessing could reduce the environmental impact of the
               massive single-use and disposal of these materials. Conventional
               sterilization techniques such as steam or dry heat, ethylene
               oxide, and gamma irradiation may alter the functional properties
               of the PPEs and/or leave toxic residues. Supercritical CO2
               (scCO2)-based sterilization is herein proposed as a safe,
               sustainable, and rapid sterilization method for contaminated face
               masks while preserving their performance. The functional
               (bacterial filtration efficiency, breathability, splash
               resistance, straps elasticity) properties of the processed FFP3
               face masks were evaluated after 1 and 10 cycles of sterilization.
               Log-6 sterilization reduction levels were obtained for face masks
               contaminated with Bacillus pumilus endospores at mild operating
               conditions (CO2 at 39 °C and 100 bar for 30 min) and with low
               contents of H2O2 (150 ppm). Physicochemical properties of the
               FFP3 face masks remained unchanged after reprocessing and
               differences in efficacy were not observed neither in the
               filtration tests, following UNE-EN 14683, nor in the integrity of
               FFP3 filtration after the sterilization process. The herein
               presented method based on scCO2 technology is the first reported
               protocol achieving the reprocessing of FFP3 masks up to 10 cycles
               while preserving their functional properties. © 2022 The Authors",

               common polymer clusters by pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass
               spectrometry. Seven polymer clusters were detected in mussel
               tissue. Summed MP levels were at ppm levels (<20 μg/g mussel, dry

               consistently higher, rather constant MP levels similar to the

               temperature, in this work, microstructured ZnSnO3 equipped with
               rambutan-like hexahedral features with the hollow interior was
               successfully synthesized through a facile one-step hydrothermal
               method. Visible light was utilized as an excitation source to
               further enhance the sensing property. The investigation
               elaborated that at optimum hydrothermal time of 16 h, ZnSnO3
               showed a high gas response (~4.65), repeatability, and long-term
               stability towards 400 ppm CO2 at room temperature. The response
               under purple light was 3.5 times higher than that under dark
               conditions, resulting from photoelectrons' generation.
               Furthermore, ZnSnO3 sensor had excellent selectivity to 50 ppm

               solidification microstructure and the thermal conductivity of
               Al-9Si based alloys have been investigated. It was found that the
               effect of Mn, Cr, V on the solidification behavior and
               solidification microstructure is mainly related to α-Al grains
               via affecting heterogeneous nucleation and growth restriction,
               while no significant effect on the solidification behavior and
               microstructure of eutectic Si was observed. Compared with factors
               including grain size of α-Al and morphology characteristics (e.g.
               size, spacing, and shape factor) of eutectic Si, the solid
               solubility in Al matrix is confirmed to be one of the most
               important factors affecting thermal conductivity. Due to the
               larger partition coefficient of V compared with Cr and Mn, the
               solid solubility and the lattice distortion of α-Al in Al-9Si-xV
               alloy were increased significantly, thus the thermal conductivity
               of alloy was decreased steeply from 171.7 to 152.3 W/m·K with the
               content of V increasing from 15 to 1010 ppm. A linearly fitted
               curve reflecting the relationship between the content of the
               transition elements and the thermal conductivity of alloys has
               been proposed, which can be used to optimize the alloy
               composition in subsequent remelting or recycling process.
               Furthermore, two thermal conductivity models (H-S model and
               Maxwell model) also have been used to evaluate the effect of Mn,
               Cr, V on thermal conductivity, in which the thermal conductivity
               of α-Al was corrected based on the measured solid solubility. In
               this way, the data correlation between the experimental and
               fitted value based on H-S model and Maxwell model is increased
               from 0.18 to 0.96. These obtained results could be helpful to
               precisely control the composition and further improve the thermal

               purpose, we relied on the push–pull-mooring (PPM) model to
               examine the consumer switching intentions from conventional food
               to organic food. To investigate this model, we utilised the
               quantitative method approach and collected 1000 valid responses
               from Chinese consumers for a better understanding of the consumer
               purchase and switching intention. Based on our findings, the
               COVID-19 pandemic strongly pushes Chinese consumer's intentions
               towards organic food, even though the organic food sector is
               relatively new in China, which started in the 1990 s and no such
               legitimate evidence found that the food processing or packaging

               La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-xCuxO3 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15) perovskites are
               fabricated as the improved electrodes of solid electrolyte cells
               (SECs) for NOx removal and the effects of Cu doping are
               investigated systematacially. Multiple characterization methods
               are carried out to analyze the physicochemical properties of
               perovskites firstly. Then the performances of cells based on
               various perovskites are evaluated by the measurements of
               electrochemical properties and NOx conversions. The results show
               that the Cu-doped electrode has more surface oxygen vacancies and
               a better redox property, thus having a higher NOx conversion and
               smaller polarization resistance. The electrode based on
               La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.9Cu0.1O3 has the maximum 70.8\% NOx conversion and
               the lowest 36.3 Ω cm2 Rp value in the atmosphere of 1000 ppm NO

               electrode is easier to form surface oxygen vacancy, while the
               surface oxygen vacancy plays an important role on electron
               transfer between electrode and NOx molecule. This study not only

               of three highly diluted C2H6/NO2 mixtures at φ = 0.5, TC = 805 –
               1038 K, and pC = 20 – 30 bar are also studied. These new
               experimental data, together with data already available in the
               literature, are used to validate NUIGMech1.2 with an updated NOx
               sub-mechanism. Although the addition of 200 ppm of NO or NO2 to
               ethane shows a minimal promoting effect, the addition of 1000 ppm
               significantly promotes its reactivity. The similarity of the
               effect of the addition of both NO and NO2 addition is due to the
               fast conversion of NO into NO2 in the presence of molecular
               oxygen. However, the 1000 ppm NO doped ethane mixtures exhibit
               ∼20\% shorter IDTs compared to the NO2 blended ones. The addition
               of 1000 ppm of N2O exhibits no effect on ethane oxidation at the
               conditions studied. The NUIGMech1.2 predictions can reproduce the

               wide range of pressure, temperature, equivalence ratio, and
               percentage dilution. Sensitivity and flux analyses of C2H6/NOx
               are performed to highlight the key reactions controlling ignition
               over the different temperature regimes studied. The analyses show

               students, teachers and staff spend long periods of the day

               assessment of ventilation rate (VR) and ventilation strategies in
               educational buildings in Southwestern Europe, Portugal and Spain.
               A representative sample of the teaching spaces of the Azurém
               Campus (Guimarães, Portugal) and the Fuentenueva Campus (Granada,
               Spain) have been analyzed. Natural ventilation is the predominant
               ventilation strategy in these spaces, being the most common
               strategy in educational buildings in Europe. VR was estimated
               under different configurations, using the CO2 decay method.
               Subsequently, the CO2 concentration was estimated according to
               occupancy and the probability of infection risk was calculated
               using the Wells-Riley equation. The obtained VR varied between
               2.9 and 20.1 air change per hour (ACH) for natural cross
               ventilation, 2.0 to 5.1 ACH for single-sided ventilation and 1.8
               to 3.5 for mechanically ventilated classrooms. Large differences
               in CO2 concentrations were verified, depending on the analyzed
               ventilation strategy, ranging from 475 to 3903 ppm for the
               different scenarios. However, the probability of risk was less
               than 1\% in almost all of the classrooms analyzed. The results
               obtained from the measurement campaign showed that the selection
               of an appropriate ventilation strategy can provide sufficient air
               renewal and maintain a low risk of infection. Ventilation

               interval of 100 bar. In addition, 10\% to 30\% of EGR flow rate
               was introduced with an interval of 5\%. Experimental results
               reveal that B100-10\%-90\% has achieved maximum brake thermal
               efficiency of 35\% at PIT of 35 °CA bTDC, MIT of 25 °CA and NOP

               PIT of 35 °CA and MIT of 25 °CA. Moreover, Nitric oxide emission
               is reduced as the EGR rate gradually increases from 10\% to 30\%;

               habitat in many parts of the world. Although it could be utilized
               as a promising source of alternative fuel, its progress is not as
               advance as biodiesel or bio-alcohol. Accordingly, a base fuel
               (BF) was blended with plastic pyrolyzed oil (PPO) to
               comprehensively investigate the usability of this product as a
               fuel substitute in compression ignition engines. Three fuels,
               BF100PPO0, BF80PPO20, and BF0PPO100, were tested and compared in
               a single-cylinder, 4-stroke, water-cooled VCR DI-CI engine that
               ran at five different compression ratios (15.5, 16.5, 17.5, 18.5,
               19.5) under low, medium, and high engine loads. In the results,
               it is noticed that except for the maximum rate of pressure rise
               and ignition delay, raising the compression ratio from 15.5 to
               19.5 did not result in significant changes. The results showed
               that BF80PPO20 produced the maximum BTE (34.4 percent) at CR 15.5
               under high engine load, while BF100PPO0 produced the lowest BSFC
               (738.29 g/kWh) at CR 16.5 under high load. In terms of emissions,
               CO2 levels were found to be essentially same for all tested fuels
               at the greatest load for all compression ratios. Furthermore,
               with CR 19.5, BF80PPO20 was able to produce the lowest smoke
               emissions at medium load. In addition, at CR 15.5 and low engine
               load, BF100PPO0 produced the lowest NOx emissions (64.3 ppm).
               Overall, based on the findings of this research, plastic waste
               oil mixed with diesel fuel at a rate of up to 20\% can be
               utilised as a promising biofuel to improve diesel engine

  abstract  = "Hydrogen, as clean and renewable energy, is regarded as a
               promising fuel applied to internal combustion engines. The
               relatively high level of Nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions is an
               important limiting factor to realize the application of hydrogen
               engine. Previous researches on the NOx emissions reduction were
               based on the naturally-aspired or supercharger hydrogen engine
               with medium load and efficiency. In this study, a 2.0 L
               turbocharged direct-injection engine is used to find the methods
               of achieving near-zero NOx emission (without any posttreatment
               equipment) with large power and high thermal efficiency. The
               effects of the coefficient of excess air (λ), the timing of the
               start of injection (SOI), and injection pressure on NOx emissions
               are investigated detailly with the engine speed range of 1000 rpm
               to 4000 rpm. The target of the NOx emission is set below 20 ppm
               according to the emission standards. A leaner combustion (λ =
               3.29@ 3000 rpm) compared to λ = 2.62@ 2000 rpm is required to
               achieve near-zero emission. The utilization of the turbocharger
               and improved injection pressure increase the power and efficiency
               simultaneously. The maximum brake mean effective pressure (BMEP)
               can reach 13.3 bar@3000 rpm, and the maximum brake thermal
               efficiency (BTE) reaches 40.4\% @2000 rpm with near-zero NOx
               emission. Various techniques, such as turbocharging, exhaust gas
               recirculation, and increased compression ratios, are also
               compared to qualify the trade-off relationships among the power,
               efficiency, and emission of the direct-injection hydrogen engine.
               These conclusions can be used to broaden the working boundary and
               optimize the fuel economy of turbocharged direct-injection

               the process of coal mining and washing. It has complex and
               volatile composites is not conducive to control its quality. If
               the high content minerals in CG could be separated relatively and
               applied properly according to its characteristics, the
               utilization of CG resources could be much more efficient. In this
               paper, granular CG was calcined and activated. According to the
               difference of color and texture, calcined coal gangue (CCG) was
               divided into yellow-white CCG (YW-C), red-brown CCG (RB-C) and
               light-red CCG (LR-S). The composition and properties of separated
               CCG were studied, and the feasibility of separating granular CCG
               based on its color, apparent density and composition difference
               was analyzed. The difference in reactivity of separated CCG and
               its causes were analyzed based on 29Si and 27Al NMR. The
               influences of separated CCG on the properties of cement-based
               materials were investigated. Results showed that, the three kinds
               of separated CCG all contained quartz, among those CCGs, LR-S has
               the highest content of quartz. YW-C contained a large amount of

               contained more colored iron phase, while LR-S contained a small
               amount of feldspar. The apparent density of RB-C and LR-S were
               significantly higher than that of YW-C. The reactivity of
               separated CCG was quite different. The relative contents of
               Q3(-101.86 ppm) structure and Al [5] in YW-C were 81.31\% and
               81.19\% respectively, which were much higher than those in LR-S.
               Comparing with LR-S, YW-C with higher pozzlanic reactivity was
               mixed into cementitious materials could react with cement
               hydration products to produce C-(A)-S-H gel which will enhance
               the interface bonding between CCG particles and matrix, refine

               effect of the combination of nanoparticles and surfactants on
               enhanced oil recovery (EOR). In this study, we investigated the
               synergistic effect of synthesized Nanocomposite (ZnO@PAM) and
               surfactant on enhanced oil recovery by performing zeta potential
               (evaluation of chemicals stability in the aqueous phase),
               adsorption, wettability alteration (evaluation of the
               quantitative and qualitative wetness), and interfacial tension
               testes. In addition, to better understand how the fluid moves
               after chemicals flood in the porous medium, the Cartesian model
               was developed in CMG-STARS. Besides, this model is valid because
               of the history match of the oil recovery data, water cut data,
               and relative permeability curves. The Nanocomposite was
               physically synthesized from polyacrylamide polymers and zinc
               oxide nanoparticles under reflux conditions. The CMC surfactant
               point was obtained by examining various parameters (pH, density,
               electrical conductivity, and IFT). In the next step, we prepared
               nano-surfactant solutions (Nanocomposites with different
               concentrations of 100 ppm, 200 ppm, 500 ppm, and 1000 ppm +
               Surfactant (CMC)). By investigating the results of the adsorption
               and zeta potential tests, it was observed that the combinations
               of Surfactant and NCs have a positive effect on each other
               (increased nanoparticle stability and decreased surfactant
               adsorption on the carbonate rock surface). The Surfactant and
               Nano-Surfactant reduced the IFT from 29.16 to 0.176 (mN/m) and
               1.354 (mN/m), respectively. In addition, the Surfactant at CMC
               and Nano-Surfactant (Surfactant (CMC) + NCs (500 ppm)) improve
               the contact angle in carbonate rock from 145.86 to 64° and
               12.79°, respectively. After the core flooding by Surfactant and
               hybrid of NCs and Surfactant, we saw an increase of 17.94\% and
               30\% in oil recovery compared to seawater floods, respectively.
               Furthermore, we observed the effect of mobility control and
               reduction of the fingering phenomenon after the flooding of
               chemicals by analyzing the simulated fluid distribution. By
               constructing the model in the core dimensions, we were able to
               get a good history matching from the laboratory data. Moreover,
               the mobility ratio after simultaneous flooding of NCs and
               surfactant compared to seawater decreased from 13.354 to 1.86,
               respectively. In addition, according to the fluid distribution
               pattern (one of the simulator outputs) the fingering phenomenon,
               was delayed after flooding the hybrid of NCs and surfactant. The
               positive effect of this type of chemical compound on mobility
               control and the fingering phenomenon has caused increased oil
               recovery. This study's findings can help to understand better how

               dominated by the atomic spectrum of O*, Hβ, and the molecular

               hydrocarbon (PAH) reduced mechanism that consists of 105 species
               and 584 reactions was developed to model the combustion and soot
               characteristics of diesel, n-butanol and its blends. The current
               mechanism was formulated by merging a n-dodecane and PAH reduced
               mechanism to a n-butanol reduced mechanism that was developed
               through the direct relation graph with error propagation (DRGEP),
               isomer lumping and reaction pathway analysis (RPA) methods. Good
               predictions were obtained when the mechanism was validated
               against the ignition delay (ID) times, species concentrations in
               jet-stirred reactor (JSR) and premixed flame and laminar flame
               speed. Moreover, the non-reacting liquid and vapour penetration
               lengths of Bu0, Bu20 and Bu40 (0 vol\%, 20 vol\% and 40 vol\%
               n-butanol blended in n-dodecane) at ambient temperatures of 800
               K, 850 K and 900 K were well predicted with a maximum deviation
               of 4\%. The ID and flame lift-off length (FLOL) deviated with a
               maximum value of 20\% and 12\%, respectively. As compared to the
               measurements, the peak soot volume fraction (SVF) of Bu0 fuel at
               ambient temperatures of 850 K and 900 K were reasonably predicted
               with maximum deviations of 1.0 ppm and 0.3 ppm, respectively. At
               higher n-butanol blending ratios and at lower ambient
               temperatures, soot was reduced significantly due to lower
               equivalence ratio, lower flame temperature and the high oxygen
               content which suppressed the formation of soot precursor species.

               investigate lead and other components in soil and bark samples
               from around a battery industrial park. In total, over 50,000
               particles ranging in size from 0.2 to 2 μm were sampled and
               approximately 15–35\% of the particles were analyzed for chemical
               composition. The mean mass spectrum results showed that the
               intensity of lead varied widely among sampling points, reaching
               the highest intensity in the topsoil and bark at sampling point
               4, located closest to the core factory. Based on the neural
               network algorithm of adaptive resonance theory (ART-2a), the
               topsoil and bark samples were classified into five categories:
               crustal composition (Ca+, silicates, aluminates, etc.), elemental
               carbon (C2-, C3−, C4−, etc.), organic carbon (CN−, levoglucosan,
               etc.), secondary inorganic sources (phosphates, nitrates,
               sulfates), and heavy metals (Pb+, Zn+, Cu+), with the proportion
               of Pb varying from 0.020 to 0.25\% and 0.030–9.41\% in topsoil
               and bark samples, respectively, while the proportion of Cu and Zn
               in topsoil and bark samples did not differ as greatly as Pb. In
               addition, the particle number concentrations of lead particles in
               topsoil and bark ranged from 0.14 to 3.48\% and 0.36–37.93\%,
               respectively. The concentrations of Pb in topsoil and bark
               samples measured by ICP-OES varied from 71 to 791 ppm and
               172–2595 ppm, respectively. Overall, both the lead content in
               topsoil samples measured by LA-SPAMS and ICP-OES reached maximum
               values at sampling points 4 and 5, respectively, indicating
               moderate pollution with Pb at these two sites. This convenient

  abstract  = "In soils and rhizospheres, iron (oxyhydr)oxides and oxyanions
               like carbonate and phosphate occur ubiquitously and their
               interaction have important implications for nutrients and metals
               cycling. An elevated activity of carbonate in soils and sediments
               (e.g., pCO2, ∼2\%) above current atmospheric CO2 (∼0.04\%) is
               observed. The level of agronomic soil test phosphorus (P) in
               intensively managed agricultural soils can be up to several
               hundred mg kg−1. Although it is known that the transformation of
               iron (oxyhydr)oxides is suppressed by phosphate adsorption, it is
               unclear how increasing carbonate activities exert the reaction
               process. Here, the effects of carbonate on the transformation of
               ferrihydrite were evaluated at pH 7.5 in the presence of
               phosphate using experimental geochemistry, Fe K-edge X-ray
               absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy-energy
               dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared
               spectroscopy. Our results, for the first time, showed that the
               inhibitory effect of phosphate on ferrihydrite transformation was
               retarded by carbonate, and it transformed into hematite. Under
               pCO2 = 408 ppm (0.213 mM carbonate), an increase in [phosphate]o
               from 0 to 0.5 mM decreased the transformation rate of
               ferrihydrite from 0.009 to 0.003 d−1. However, the suppression
               was drastically perturbed when carbonate was added to the
               phosphate-ferrihydrite system. When 11.42 mM carbonate (pCO2 =
               20000 ppmv) was present, the rate increased from 0.009 to 0.033
               d−1 without phosphate and from 0.003 to 0.018 d−1 with 0.5 mM of
               phosphate. Moreover, carbonate promoted the formation of more
               crystalline rhombic hematite particles, while phosphate modified
               the morphology of hematite from rhombic to ellipsoidal-like with
               rough surfaces. The distinctive difference of the influence of
               carbonate and phosphate on the transformation kinetics, products
               distribution, and morphologies come from the interaction between
               carbonate/phosphate and ferrihydrite. Although phosphate formed
               strong inner-sphere complexes on the ferrihydrite surface, which
               inhibited the direct contact and dissolution of ferrihydrite,
               co-adsorbed carbonate still promoted the olation reaction,
               facilitating the formation of hematite. These results suggest
               that as an important geochemical process, the increasing activity
               of carbonate or pCO2 can override the retarding impact of
               phosphate on the transformation of ferrihydrite and control the
               occurrence/crystallization of hematite in the subsurface soils
               under the scenario of climate change. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",

               shown to be a promising alternative to conventional diesel owing
               to its ability to substantially reduce carbon and hydrocarbon
               emissions. However, an increase in the NOx due to the additional
               oxygen content from the fuel has led to different fuel
               pretreatment and exhaust gas after-treatment methods to curb
               emissions. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been recently
               investigated as an oxidant and emulsifier in biodiesel blends for
               CI engines. Although combustion improvement leading to reduced HC
               and CO emissions are reported, contrasting findings are found in
               the literature on the effect of NOx. Similarly, CeO2
               nanoparticles have demonstrated its capability in NOx abatement
               and hence this paper aims to assess the combined effect of H2O2
               concentration and CeO2 nanoparticles on the performance and
               exhaust emissions using B20 fuel. Three different concentrations
               of H2O2 (0.5\%, 1\%, and 1.5\%) along with two levels of CeO2
               nanoparticle concentrations (40, 80 ppm) are investigated.
               Maximum brake thermal efficiency (BTE) is observed at 75\% load
               and 1.5\% H2O2 concentration with an average improvement of 1.2\%
               in BTE over neat B20. The average reduction in CO and HC
               emissions for 1.5\% H2O2 emulsification over neat B20 is 56–60\%
               and 41–48\% respectively. For the H2O2 concentration of 0.5\%,
               1\%, and 1.5\%, the average decrease in NOx compared to B20 fuel
               is 5.6\%, 16.1\%, and 22.7\% respectively. Increasing the
               nanoparticle concentration from 40 ppm to 80 ppm also decreases
               emissions and improves BTE but its impact is significantly lower
               compared to the effect of H2O2 emulsification. Increasing H2O2
               concentration in fuel blend improves the micro explosions leading
               to better mixing of fuel and air promoting better combustion.
               This resulted in the reduction of CO, HC, and NOx emissions as
               H2O2 is an active carrier of O2 and •OH radicals which has a more
               dominant effect in improving combustion and reducing emissions. ©

               carried out. The numerical simulation reasonably predicts the
               measured penetration length, ignition delay, flame lift-off
               length, and soot volume fraction at quasi-steady state, providing
               a good baseline for the subsequent analysis. The active subspace
               method has been applied to perform global sensitivity analysis,
               with the peak soot volume fraction on centerline (PSVF-c) and the
               axial location of the peak soot volume fraction on centerline
               (LPSVF-c) at 4 ms being chosen as the quantities of interest
               (QoIs), and the parameters in soot and turbulence model being
               considered as the uncertainty inputs. It is found that at the
               early stage of the spray flame, e.g., 1 ms after the start of
               injection, more than one dimensional active subspace is needed to
               characterize the input space, while the active subspace tends to
               one dimension as the spray flame approaches the quasi-steady
               state. At the quasi-steady state of the spray flame, surface
               growth rate parameter is the controlling parameter for PSVF-c.
               Meanwhile, LPSVF-c is controlled by turbulence model parameters.
               Uncertainty quantification for soot formation is performed by
               constructing the response surfaces in the active subspace to map
               the input parameters to the QoIs. The 95\% confidence interval
               due to the uncertainty of turbulence model, soot model and the
               overall uncertainty of these two models are [6.64,6.91],
               [6.59,8.05] and [6.52,8.02] ppm for PSVF-c, and [78.17,81.02],
               [79.39,80.21] and [78.26,81.22] mm for LPSVF-c. This work
               demonstrates the potential of using the active subspace method
               for global sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification of
               the soot formation in turbulent spray flames. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",

               various engine loads (from 3 Nm to 12 Nm with 3 Nm increments) at
               a fixed crankshaft speed of 2400 rpm. D90E10Al2O3 showed the best
               energy, exergy, exergoenvironmental, and sustainability results
               among all fuels. However, according to exergoeconomic analysis,
               the lowest cost of crankshaft work was obtained with D100,
               followed by D90E10Al2O3. This means that D90E10Al2O3 presented

               D90E10TiO2 but worse exergoeconomic results than D100. The
               addition of ethanol to D100 excessively increased the fuel cost.
               As a result, the crankshaft work cost flow rate is 0.7645 $/h for

               fault-tolerant survivability, better power/torque distribution,
               and highly efficient systems will help to shift toward multiphase
               induction motors (MIMs). The MIMs are driven with multiphase
               power converters, where the usage of a higher order of switches
               escalate failure possibilities. For attaining the better fault
               tolerance of switch faults, many inverter configurations are
               established in the literature; however, these studies have not
               addressed the multiple switch faults in different inverter legs.
               Moreover, for the source fault of the multiphase drive, the
               entire system has to be halted. In this article, a distributed
               powertrain structure is proposed for electric vehicle
               applications to fulfil the gaps in the aforementioned critical
               issues. A fault-tolerant multiphase inverter (FTMI) fed
               nine-phase induction motor (NPIM) drive is proposed with a lesser
               number of auxiliary components, such as switches and fuses. The
               proposed FTMI has effectively utilized the concept of pole-phase
               modulation (PPM) for NPIM, which helps in operating the drive at
               two possible modes (9-phase 4-pole and 3-phase 12-pole). With
               this additional flexibility of PPM, the proposed FTMI fed NPIM

               single/multiple switch open/short-circuit faults and source
               faults contrary to the existing techniques. The pros and cons of

               with a clear comparison over existed fault-tolerant drive
               configurations. The practicability of the proposed FTMI fed NPIM

               laser to drive the IFOG for its better frequency stabilization
               characteristics instead of the broadband light source. As the
               linewidth of laser is narrow, the errors of coherent
               backscattering, polarization coupling, and Kerr effect are
               reintroduced which cause more noise and drift. This paper studies
               laser spectrum broadening based on external phase modulation of
               Gaussian white noise (GWN). The theoretical analysis and test
               results indicate that this method has a good effect on spectrum
               broadening and can be used to improve the performance of the
               laser-driven IFOG. In the established closed-loop IFOG, a
               four-state modulation (FSM) is adopted to avoid temperature
               instability of the multifunction integrated-optic chip (MIOC) and
               drift caused by the electronic circuit in demodulation. The
               experimental results show that the IFOG driven by broadened laser
               has the angular random walk noise of 0.003 8 °/√h and the drift
               of 0.017 °/h, which are 62\% and 66\% better than those without
               modulation respectively, of which the drift has reached the level
               of the broadband light source. Although the noise still needs
               further reduction, its scale factor stability is 0.38 ppm, which
               has an overwhelming advantage compared with the traditional IFOG.

               warm-bore diameter of 52 mm for high-frequency gyrotrons in Wuhan
               National High Magnetic Field Center, China. This method includes
               3 main routines: linear programming (LP) code to get the
               non-rectangular coil design, coil-picking code to get rectangular
               coil design, and nonlinear programming (NLP) code to get final
               integer coil design by using rectangular coil design as initial
               input. The designed magnet includes Inner, Middle and Outer coils
               which consist of 34, 56 and 68 double pancakes (DP) wound by 4 mm
               x 0.1 mm bare YBCO tape, respectively. The designed peak-peak
               field in-homogeneity is 50 ppm within 10 mm Diameter of Spherical
               Volume (DSV). The designed 5 Gauss line is restricted in a
               cylinder with the sizes of 10 m in axial direction and 8 m in
               radial direction, respectively. The maximum hoop stress is
               limited below 450 MPa. Layer-layer separation happens in the

               reduction (SCR) is the most effective way to reduce particulate
               emission and nitrogen oxide (NOx) from diesel engines. In this
               study, the effects of a DOC+CDPF+SCR system on the emissions
               including carbon monoxide (CO) total hydrocarbon (THC), NOx,
               particle number (PN) and particle mass (PM) from a heavy-duty
               diesel engine were evaluated. In addition, the influences of
               ammonia (NH3) slip catalyst (ASC) coating and SCR catalyst
               downsizing on the NOx conversion efficiency, nitrous oxide (N2O)
               emissions and NH3 slip were also investigated. Results showed
               that the installation of the after-treatment system had
               negligible effect on the power and BSFC of the engine. The
               upstream DOC reduced by an average of 97.0\% of the CO and 67.5\%
               of the THC, in combination with CDPF, the CO and THC emission
               further decreased with an average drop of 97.8\% and 72.5\%,
               respectively. In terms of particulate emissions, the single DOC
               reduced 48.0\% of the PN and 50.9\% of the PM, and the
               combination of DOC and CDPF led to a reduction of 98.0\% in the
               PN and 96.9\% in the PM on average. The SCR was effective in
               reducing NOx emission, but resulted in higher N2O emission by
               more than 3 times, meanwhile led to an average NH3 slip of 3.80
               ppm. Downsizing the SCR length by 1/3 could still ensure a 91.9\%
               conversion efficiency of NOx, and produced less N2O, but led to
               an increase of the NH3 slip by 2 times, reaching 7.63 ppm on
               average. By coating Pt-based ASC catalyst on the back end of the
               SCR could eliminate the NH3 slip. Considering the cost and
               performance, the combination of DOC, CDPF and a downsized SCR
               with ASC coating may be a better choice. © 2021 The Author(s)",

               surfactants on the interfacial tension and wettability related to
               EOR processes. Various experiments were conducted such as
               measuring interfacial tension between oil and brine using
               spinning drop tensiometer, measuring contact angle between
               surfactant-NPs-brine solution and Buff Berea core using optical
               tensiometer, conducting spontaneous imbibition, and core flooding
               tests. It is observed that the more anionic surfactant in the
               mixture the more significant aluminosilicate reduces contact
               angle and increases interfacial tension (IFT), which promotes
               contradicting effect on oil recovery. In this study, the IFT
               prevails and eventually reduces ultimate oil recovery. At
               spontaneous imbibition tests the ultimate oil recovery is
               decreased from 58\% to 47\% and from 63\% to 46\% for SAE-01A and

               54\% to 35\% and from 50\% to 39\% at core flooding tests (Figure
               16) for SAE-01A and SAE-01B, respectively. The aluminosilicate
               nanoparticle contributes positively as the ratio of SAE and FEO
               becomes smaller. At surfactant formulation ratio of 1:2
               (SAE-01C), the IFT is decreased slightly from 4.36 x 10−3 mN/m to
               2.36 x 10−3 mN/m and contact angle is also slightly reduced from
               41.9° to 40.3° by adding 250 ppm NPs. The results show that
               ultimate oil recovery is increased 52\% to 61\% and from 47\% to

               petroleum production due to the low productivity of old wells.
               Furthermore, an appropriate technology, such as Enhanced Oil
               Recovery (EOR) technology, is needed to maximize the productivity
               of the old well. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to
               synthesize a polymeric surfactant for the EOR process from sodium
               lignosulfonate (SLS) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) in various SLS
               to PEG ratios, namely 1:1 (PS1), 1:0.8 (PS2), and 1:0.5 (PS3).
               The surfactants were characterized using several methods, such as
               Fourier Transform-Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), compatibility,
               stability, viscosity, and phase behavior tests. The performance
               of the surfactants for the EOR process in different brine
               solution concentrations (16,000 ppm and 20,000 ppm) was also
               studied. The result showed that the introduction of the PEG
               molecule to the surfactant had been successfully conducted as
               FT-IR analysis confirmed. The surfactant's hydrophilicity
               increased with the introduction of PEG due to the increase of the
               ether group. A Winsor Type I or lower phase microemulsion was
               formed due to the high hydrophilicity. The highest oil yield (79
               \%) was obtained by PS1 surfactant, which has the highest PEG
               dosage, in a brine solution of 1,600 ppm. Therefore, it was
               concluded that the introduction of PEG could increase the

               critical stress. Weaning can negatively affect the growth
               performance of animals physically, psychologically, and
               pathologically. Our previous studies on the HT-29 cell line and
               early-weaned rats demonstrated that adequate sophorolipid (SPL)
               supplementation in feed could enhance the mucin-producing and
               wound healing capacities of the gut defense system by modulating
               gut microbiota. Methods: We conducted an experiment with one
               hundred forty 21-day-old early weaned piglets (L x Y x D). They
               were allocated into 4 treatment and 7 replications (4 pigs per
               pen) according to their initial body weight. Body weight and feed
               intake were measured biweekly during experimental period. After 6
               weeks, 28 pigs were randomly selected and sacrificed to collect
               plasma, jejunum, and cecal content samples. Results: Dietary SPL
               supplementation at 5 and 10 mg/kg quadratically increased the
               average daily gain during the experimental period in the
               treatment groups when compared with the control group. The
               albumin levels of piglets fed with the SPL supplemented diet were
               downregulated to the normal range. Moreover, in feed, SPL
               supplementation at 5 and 10 mg/kg improved jejunal histological
               indices and gene expression levels related to mucin secretion and
               local inflammation markers. Consistent with these results,
               adequate SPL supplementation (5 and 10 mg/kg) increased the
               population of Prevotella, a beneficial bacterium, and its
               short-chain fatty acid production in the ceca of piglets.
               Conclusions: The occurrence of diarrhea after weaning in piglets
               could be reduced by feeding a 10 ppm of SPL supplemented diet
               which improves the gut defense system by improving the microbial
               population and enhancing mucin layer integrity. © 2021, The

  abstract  = "Background: Fish encounter oxidative stress several times during
               their lifetime, and it has a pervasive influence on their health
               and welfare. One of the triggers of oxidative stress in fish
               farming is the use of oxidative disinfectants to improve rearing
               conditions, especially in production systems employing
               recirculation technology. Here we report the physiological and
               morphological adaptive responses of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar
               L.) post-smolts to intermittent exposure to a potent oxidative
               agent peracetic acid (PAA). Fish reared in semi-commercial scale
               brackish water recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) were
               exposed to 1 ppm PAA every 3 days over 6 weeks. Mucosal and
               systemic responses were profiled before exposure, 22 and 45 days
               during the intermittent PAA administration. Results: Oxidative
               stress was likely triggered as plasma antioxidant capacity
               increased significantly during the exposure period. Adaptive
               stress response to the periodic oxidant challenge was likewise
               demonstrated in the changes in plasma glucose and lactate levels.
               PAA-induced alterations in the transcription of antioxidants,
               cytokines, heat shock proteins and mucin genes showed a
               tissue-specific pattern: downregulation was observed in the gills
               and olfactory rosette, upregulation occurred in the skin, and no
               substantial changes in the liver. Further, PAA exposure resulted
               in histological changes in key mucosal organs (i.e. olfactory
               rosette, skin and gills); pathological alterations were
               predominant in the gills where cases of epithelial lifting,
               hypertrophy and clubbing were prevalent. In addition,
               intermittent PAA administration resulted in an apparent
               overproduction of mucus in the nasal mucosa. Lastly, PAA did not
               dramatically alter the ability of salmon to mount a physiological
               stress response in the presence of a secondary stressor, though
               some subtle interference was documented in the kinetics and
               magnitude of plasma cortisol and glucose response post-stress.
               Conclusions: The present study collectively demonstrated that
               intermittent oxidant exposure was a mild environmental stressor
               that salmon could mount strong adaptive responses at systemic and
               mucosal levels. The results will be valuable in optimising the
               rearing conditions of post-smolts in RAS, especially in adopting
               water treatment strategies that do not considerably interfere
               with fish health and welfare. © 2021, The Author(s).",

               improving its nutrient retention capacity. The potential soil
               application of ozonized biochar warrants the need for a toxicity
               study that investigates its effects on microorganisms. Results:
               In the study presented here, we found that the filtrates
               collected from ozonized pine 400 biochar and ozonized rogue
               biochar did not have any inhibitory effects on the soil
               environmental bacteria Pseudomonas putida, even at high dissolved
               organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of 300 ppm. However, the
               growth of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 was inhibited by the
               ozonized biochar filtrates at DOC concentrations greater than 75
               ppm. Further tests showed the presence of some potential
               inhibitory compounds (terephthalic acid and p-toluic acid) in the
               filtrate of non-ozonized pine 400 biochar; these compounds were
               greatly reduced upon wet-ozonization of the biochar material.
               Nutrient detection tests also showed that dry-ozonization of
               rogue biochar enhanced the availability of nitrate and phosphate
               in its filtrate, a property that may be desirable for soil
               application. Conclusion: Ozonized biochar substances can support
               soil environmental bacterium Pseudomonas putida growth, since
               ozonization detoxifies the potential inhibitory aromatic
               molecules. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see

               of formaldehyde in the workplace, according to published studies.
               Studies from occupational genotoxic damage of formaldehyde were
               retrieved using search in databases such as Google Scholar, Web
               of Science, and PubMed until April 2020. The search strategy was
               established based on the words -formaldehyde‖, -genotoxicity‖,
               -carcinogenicity‖, -DNA damage,‖ and -occupational exposure‖.
               Based on dose-response data from three studies, benchmark dose
               (BMD) analysis was performed using EPA-BMD Software. Finally,
               five studies were included in the final BMDL conclusion.
               Polynomial and Hill models were used for BMDL evaluation in three
               studies, and BMD of formaldehyde was estimated between 0.062 to
               0.26 ppm. The lowest level of BMDL (0.028 ppm) in five studies
               was considered the basic value for genotoxicity risk assessment.

               create a positive feedback loop of climate warming and further
               GHG emissions. Active methane uptake in these soils can reduce
               the impact of GHG on future Arctic warming potential. Aerobic
               methane oxidizers are thought to be responsible for this apparent
               methane sink, though Arctic representatives of these organisms
               have resisted culturing efforts. Here, we first used in situ gas
               flux measurements and qPCR to identify relative methane sink
               hotspots at a high Arctic cytosol site, we then labeled the
               active microbiome in situ using DNA Stable Isotope Probing (SIP)
               with heavy 13CH4 (at 100 ppm and 1000 ppm). This was followed by
               amplicon and metagenome sequencing to identify active organisms
               involved in CH4 metabolism in these high Arctic cryosols.
               Sequencing of 13C-labeled pmoA genes demonstrated that type II
               methanotrophs (Methylocapsa) were overall the dominant active
               methane oxidizers in these mineral cryosols, while type I
               methanotrophs (Methylomarinovum) were only detected in the 100
               ppm SIP treatment. From the SIP-13C-labeled DNA, we retrieved
               nine high to intermediate quality metagenome-assembled genomes
               (MAGs) belonging to the Proteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and
               Chloroflexi, with three of these MAGs containing genes associated
               with methanotrophy. A novel Chloroflexi MAG contained a mmoX gene
               along with other methane oxidation pathway genes, identifying it
               as a potential uncultured methane oxidizer. This MAG also
               contained genes for copper import, synthesis of biopolymers,
               mercury detoxification, and ammonia uptake, indicating that this
               bacterium is strongly adapted to conditions in active layer
               permafrost and providing new insights into methane biogeochemical
               cycling. In addition, Betaproteobacterial MAGs were also
               identified as potential cross-feeders with methanotrophs in these
               Arctic cryosols. Overall, in situ SIP labeling combined with

               respiratory tract leading to severe disease and significant
               mortality. Ever since the start of SARS-CoV-2, also known as the
               COVID-19 pandemic, countless uncertainties have been revolving
               around the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2
               infection. While air pollution has been shown to be strongly
               correlated to increased SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality,
               whether environmental pollutants such as ground-level ozone
               affects the susceptibility of individuals to SARS-CoV-2 is not
               yet established. To investigate the impact of ozone inhalation on
               the expression levels of signatures associated with host
               susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed lung tissues collected
               from mice that were sub-chronically exposed to air or 0.8 ppm
               ozone for three weeks (4 h/night, 5 nights/week), and analyzed
               the expression of signatures associated with host susceptibility
               to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells is dependent
               on the binding of the virus to the host cellular receptor,
               angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), and its subsequent
               proteolytic priming by the host-derived protease, transmembrane
               protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The Ace2 transcripts were
               significantly elevated in the parenchyma, but not in the
               extrapulmonary airways and alveolar macrophages, from
               ozone-exposed mice. The TMPRSS2 protein and Tmprss2 transcripts
               were significantly elevated in the extrapulmonary airways,
               parenchyma, and alveolar macrophages from ozone-exposed mice. A
               significant proportion of additional known SARS-CoV-2 host
               susceptibility genes were upregulated in alveolar macrophages and
               parenchyma from ozone-exposed mice. Our data indicate that the
               unhealthy levels of ozone in the environment may predispose
               individuals to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the severity of
               this pandemic and the challenges associated with direct testing
               of host-environment interactions in clinical settings, we believe
               that this ozone exposure-based study informs the scientific

               determine the readiness of various stakeholders to engage in
               implementing the DPPM strategy. Methods: The research design was
               sequential exploratory mixed methods. A qualitative study in the
               first stage was carried out through in-depth interviews, FGD and
               study documents. Data were analyzed through coding, categorizing,
               pattern matching and theorizing. The second stage was a survey
               conducted using instruments built in the first stage. Data were
               analyzed using Rasch modeling and logistic regression. Results:
               District TB case detection rate (CDR) has improved from 35\%
               (2018) to 104\% (2019). The contribution of private hospitals has
               increased considerably. However, there were almost none from the
               private primary healthcare facilities. The substantive theory
               generated indicates that awareness and concern of the TB problem,
               TB program comprehension and involvement, and institutional
               support are behind the readiness of facilities to engage the TB
               program (the readiness to engage). The measurement results
               indicate the significant correlation of all dimensions on
               readiness to engage. Concern of the TB problem and institutional
               support are variables that influence readiness to engage (p <
               0.05). Conclusions: Engaging private and public facility
               stakeholders is a challenge for local government. Intervention is

               climate change, especially in agricultural systems where soil P
               availability is low. Methods: This study used rhizoboxes to
               physically separate rhizosphere regions (plant root-soil
               interface) into 1.5-mm segments. Wheat plants were grown in
               rhizoboxes under eCO2 (800 ppm) and ambient CO2 (400 ppm) in two
               farming soils, Chromosol and Vertosol, supplemented with phytate
               (organic P). Photosynthetic carbon flow in the plant-soil
               continuum was traced with 13CO2 labeling. Amplicon sequencing was
               performed on the rhizosphere-associated microbial community in
               the root-growth zone, and 1.5 mm and 3 mm away from the root.
               Results: Elevated CO2 accelerated the mineralization of phytate
               in the rhizosphere zones, which corresponded with increases in
               plant-derived 13C enrichment and the relative abundances of
               discreet phylogenetic clades containing Bacteroidetes and
               Gemmatimonadetes in the bacterial community, and Funneliformis
               affiliated to arbuscular mycorrhizas in the fungal community.
               Although the amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) associated the
               stimulation of phytate mineralization under eCO2 differed between
               the two soils, these ASVs belonged to the same phyla associated
               with phytase and phosphatase production. The symbiotic
               mycorrhizas in the rhizosphere of wheat under eCO2 benefited from
               increased plant C supply and increased P access from soil.
               Further supportive evidence was the eCO2-induced increase in the
               genetic pool expressing the pentose phosphate pathway, which is
               the central pathway for biosynthesis of RNA/DNA precursors.
               Conclusions: The results suggested that an increased belowground
               carbon flow under eCO2 stimulated bacterial growth, changing
               community composition in favor of phylotypes capable of degrading
               aromatic P compounds. It is proposed that energy investments by
               bacteria into anabolic processes increase under eCO2 to level
               microbial P-use efficiencies and that synergies with symbiotic
               mycorrhizas further enhance the competition for and
               mineralization of organic P. [MediaObject not available: see

               Meanwhile, the impact of renewable diesel exhaust, such as
               hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), on human health is less known.
               Nineteen healthy volunteers were exposed to HVO exhaust for 3 h
               in a chamber with a double-blind, randomized setup. Exposure
               scenarios comprised of HVO exhaust from two modern non-road
               vehicles with 1) no aftertreatment system (‘HVOPM+NOx’ PM1: 93 µg
               m−3, EC: 54 µg m−3, NO: 3.4 ppm, NO2: 0.6 ppm), 2) an
               aftertreatment system containing a diesel oxidation catalyst and
               a diesel particulate filter (‘HVONOx’ PM1: ~ 1 µg m−3, NO: 2.0
               ppm, NO2: 0.7 ppm) and 3) filtered air (FA) as control. The
               exposure concentrations were in line with current EU occupational
               exposure limits (OELs) of NO, NO2, formaldehyde, polycyclic
               aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and the future OEL (2023) of
               elemental carbon (EC). The effect on nasal patency, pulmonary
               function, and self-rated symptoms were assessed. Calculated
               predicted lung deposition of HVO exhaust particles was compared
               to data from an earlier diesel exhaust study. Results: The
               average total respiratory tract deposition of PM1 during
               HVOPM+NOx was 27 µg h−1. The estimated deposition fraction of HVO
               PM1 was 40–50\% higher compared to diesel exhaust PM1 from an
               older vehicle (earlier study), due to smaller particle sizes of
               the HVOPM+NOx exhaust. Compared to FA, exposure to HVOPM+NOx and
               HVONOx caused higher incidence of self-reported symptoms (78\%,
               63\%, respectively, vs. 28\% for FA, p < 0.03). Especially,
               exposure to HVOPM+NOx showed 40–50\% higher eye and throat
               irritation symptoms. Compared to FA, a decrement in nasal patency
               was found for the HVONOx exposures (− 18.1, 95\% CI: − 27.3 to −
               8.8 L min−1, p < 0.001), and for the HVOPM+NOx (− 7.4 (− 15.6 to
               0.8) L min−1, p = 0.08). Overall, no clinically significant
               change was indicated in the pulmonary function tests (spirometry,
               peak expiratory flow, forced oscillation technique). Conclusion:
               Short-term exposure to HVO exhaust concentrations corresponding
               to EU OELs for one workday did not cause adverse pulmonary
               function changes in healthy subjects. However, an increase in
               self-rated mild irritation symptoms, and mild decrease in nasal
               patency after both HVO exposures, may indicate irritative effects
               from exposure to HVO exhaust from modern non-road vehicles, with
               and without aftertreatment systems. © 2022, The Author(s).",

               field. Here, a stretchable, self-healable, self-adhesive, and
               room-temperature oxygen sensor with excellent repeatability, a
               full concentration detection range (0-100\%), low theoretical
               limit of detection (5.7 ppm), high sensitivity (0.2\%/ppm), good
               linearity, excellent temperature, and humidity tolerances is
               fabricated by using polyacrylamide-chitosan (PAM-CS) double
               network (DN) organohydrogel as a novel transducing material. The
               PAM-CS DN organohydrogel is transformed from the PAM-CS composite
               hydrogel using a facile soaking and solvent replacement strategy.
               Compared with the pristine hydrogel, the DN organohydrogel
               displays greatly enhanced mechanical strength, moisture
               retention, freezing resistance, and sensitivity to oxygen.
               Notably, applying the tensile strain improves both the
               sensitivity and response speed of the organohydrogel-based oxygen
               sensor. Furthermore, the response to the same concentration of
               oxygen before and after self-healing is basically the same.
               Importantly, we propose an electrochemical reaction mechanism to
               explain the positive current shift of the oxygen sensor and
               corroborate this sensing mechanism through rationally designed

               affects the number of malaria mosquito vectors entering houses.
               This study hypothesized that indoor light from a CDC-light trap,
               visible from outside a hut, would increase entry of Anopheles
               arabiensis, an important malaria vector, and examined whether
               ventilation modifies this effect. Methods: Four inhabited
               experimental huts, each situated within a large chamber, were
               used to assess how light and ventilation affect the number of
               hut-entering mosquitoes in Tanzania. Each night, 300 female
               laboratory-reared An. arabiensis were released inside each
               chamber for 72 nights. Nightly mosquito collections were made
               using light traps placed indoors. Temperature and carbon dioxide
               concentrations were measured using data loggers. Treatments and
               sleepers were rotated between huts using a randomized block
               design. Results: When indoor light was visible outside the huts,
               there was an 84\% increase in the odds of collecting mosquitoes
               indoors (Odds ratio, OR = 1.84, 95\% confidence intervals, 95\%
               CI 1.74–1.95, p < 0.001) compared with when it was not. Although
               the odds of collecting mosquitoes in huts with closed eaves (OR =
               0.54, 95\% CI 0.41–0.72, p < 0.001) was less than those with open
               eaves, few mosquitoes entered either type of well-ventilated hut.
               The odds of collecting mosquitoes was 99\% less in
               well-ventilated huts, compared with poorly-ventilated traditional
               huts (OR = 0.01, 95\% CI 0.01–0.03, p < 0.001). In
               well-ventilated huts, indoor temperatures were 1.3 °C (95\% CI
               0.9–1.7, p < 0.001) cooler, with lower carbon dioxide (CO2)
               levels (mean difference = 97 ppm, 77.8–116.2, p < 0.001) than in
               poorly-ventilated huts. Conclusion: Although light visible from
               outside a hut increased mosquito house entry, good natural
               ventilation reduces indoor carbon dioxide concentrations, a major
               mosquito attractant, thereby reducing mosquito-hut entry. © 2022,

               inhibitors were commonly used to manage plant-parasitic
               nematodes. However, nematodes resistant to AChE inhibitors have
               been increasingly reported due to the extensive use of these
               chemicals. The current study was aimed to establish the
               correlation between fenamiphos (an AChE-inhibitor) sensitivities
               and acetylcholinesterase genes (ace) by analyzing two isolates of
               A. besseyi (designated Rl and HSF), which displayed differential
               sensitivities to fenamiphos. The concentrations of fenamiphos
               that led to the death of 50\% (LD50) of Rl and HSF were 572.2 ppm
               and 129.4 ppm, respectively. Three ace genes were cloned from A.
               besseyi and sequenced. Sequence searching and phylogenic analyses
               revealed that AChEs of R1 and HSF shared strong similarities with
               those of various vertebrate and invertebrate species. Molecular
               docking analysis indicated that AChEs-HSF had much higher
               affinities to fenamiphos than AChEs-R1. Quantitative reverse
               transcriptase-PCR analyses revealed that expression of three ace
               genes were downregulated in HSF but were upregulated in Rl after
               exposure to 100 ppm fenamiphos for 12 h. The results indicated
               that the expression of the ace genes was modulated in response to
               fenamiphos in different nematode strains. An increased expression
               of the ace genes might contribute to fenamiphos-insensitivity as

  abstract  = "To improve cancer precision medicine, prognostic and predictive
               biomarkers are critically needed to aid physicians in deciding
               treatment strategies in a personalized fashion. Due to the
               heterogeneous nature of cancer, most biomarkers are expected to
               be valid only in a subset of patients. Furthermore, there is no
               current approach to determine the applicability of biomarkers. In
               this study, we propose a framework to improve the clinical
               application of biomarkers. As part of this framework, we develop
               a clinical outcome prediction model (CPM) and a predictability
               prediction model (PPM) for each biomarker and use these models to
               calculate a prognostic score (P-score) and a confidence score
               (C-score) for each patient. Each biomarker’s P-score indicates
               its association with patient clinical outcomes, while each
               C-score reflects the biomarker applicability of the biomarker’s
               CPM to a patient and therefore the confidence of the clinical
               prediction. We assessed the effectiveness of this framework by
               applying it to three biomarkers, Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, and an
               E2F4 signature, which have been used for predicting patient
               response, pathologic complete response versus residual disease to
               neoadjuvant chemotherapy (a classification problem), and
               recurrence-free survival (a Cox regression problem) in breast
               cancer, respectively. In both applications, our analyses
               indicated patients with higher C scores were more likely to be
               correctly predicted by the biomarkers, indicating the
               effectiveness of our framework. This framework provides a useful
               approach to develop and apply biomarkers in the context of cancer

  abstract  = "Recently, plant essential oils (EOs) have attracted special
               attention in plant disease control and food preservation. Since
               ancient times, essential oils extracted from plants have
               exhibited many biological characteristics, especially
               antimicrobial properties. Recent studies have described the
               potentials of EOs and derivatives to inhibit the growth and
               reproduction of microorganisms, mainly in response of
               overwhelming concerns of consumers about food safety. In the
               context of returning to nature, with the advancement of science
               and technology and improved living standards, people have begun
               to seek solutions for food hygiene without chemical additives.
               Therefore, biological pesticides and plant-oriented chemicals
               have received special attention from scientists because they are
               environmentally friendly and nonhazardous, sustainable, and
               effective alternatives against many noxious phytopathogens.
               Present study is intended to appraise the fungicidal properties
               of ginger EOs to combat leaf blight disease of taro, which
               threatens global taro production. Farmers often hinge on
               extremely toxic synthetic fungicides to manage diseases, but the
               residual effects and resistance of chemicals are unavoidable. The
               microwave-assisted hydrodistillation method was used for ginger
               EOs extraction and an FTIR (ATR) spectrometer was used to
               evaluate their chemical composition and citral was identified as
               most abundant compound (89.05\%) in oil. The pathogen isolated
               from lesions of diseased taro plants was identified as
               Phytophthora colocasiae and used as test fungus in the present
               study. Ginger EO was evaluated in-vitro for antifungal properties
               against mycelium growth, sporangium production, zoospore
               germination, leaf, and corm necrosis inhibition. Repeated
               experiments have shown that the concentration of ginger essential
               oil (1250 ppm) proved to be the lowest dose to obtain 100\%
               inhibition of fungal growth and spore germination, sporangia
               formation and leaf necrosis assessment. These results are derived
               from this fungal species and a hypothesis that involves further
               research on other plant pathogens to demonstrate the overall
               potency of essential oils. This study references the easy,

  abstract  = "Background: Land degradation is an urgent agenda that requires
               great effort and resources to ameliorate. It worsens soil
               components through disrupting ecological functions and threatens
               agriculture production. To overcome it, different soil and water
               conservation (SWC) practices have been undertaken in numerous
               parts of Ethiopia. This paper aims to review the effects of SWC
               practices on soil physicochemical properties and crop yield. Data
               were collected from secondary sources via a computer library
               using various databases based on developed criteria. The
               collected data were organized, categorized, and analyzed through
               descriptive statistics. The mean difference of selected soil
               physicochemical properties obtained from treated and untreated
               farmland was tested using paired t-test. Factors influencing crop
               yield on treated farmland were determined by a multiple linear
               regression model. Results: SWC practices influenced the soil
               physicochemical properties and crop yield either positively or
               negatively. The mean values of available phosphorus (10.6 ppm,
               8.7 ppm), total nitrogen (0.5\%, 0.4\%), soil pH (6.0\%, 5.8\%),
               soil organic matter (4.4\%, 3.8\%), and soil organic carbon
               (2.2\%, 1.8\%) were on treated and untreated farmland under
               physical SWC practices, respectively. Similarly, the mean values
               of these variables were higher on treated farmland than untreated
               farmland under both biological and integrated SWC practices. The
               mean value of bulk density was higher on untreated farmland than
               treated one and statistically significant under all SWC
               practices. Fanya juu and stone-faced soil bund constantly
               increased crop yield, whereas soil bund and stone bund did not.
               Conclusion: Proper implementation of SWC technologies through
               integrating physical and biological measures will boost the
               effectiveness of the practice in restoring soil physicochemical
               properties and improving crop yield. Meanwhile, government due
               attention paid for land resources management in Ethiopia, whereby
               the annual SWC and tree planting campaign underwent for a couple
               of decades, entails further scientific support for its efficacy.

               multifarious biocidal activities. To understand whether eugenol
               would persistently work against Aedes aegypti, we performed
               larvicidal bioassays on thirty successive generations and
               determined median lethal concentration (LC50) on each generation.
               Results showed no apparent differences between LC50 at F0 (63.48
               ppm) and F30 (64.50 ppm) indicating no alteration of
               susceptibility toward eugenol. To analyze, if eugenol has any
               effect on metabolic detoxification-associated enzymes, we
               measured esterases (alpha and beta), cytochrome P450, and GST
               activities from the survived larvae exposed to LC50 concentration
               from F0–F30. Results revealed a decrease of esterases, GST, and
               cytochrome P450 activities at the initial 4–8 generations and
               then a gradual increase as the generations progressed. GST
               activity remained significantly below the control groups.
               Synergists (TPP, DEM, and PBO) were applied along with eugenol at
               F30 and LC50 concentration, and the said enzyme activities were
               recorded. Results showed a noticeable decrease in LC50 and enzyme
               activities indicating effective inhibitions of the respective
               enzymes. Overall, present results inferred that eugenol would
               effectively work as a larvicide for a longer period in successive
               generations without initiating rapid resistance and therefore
               could be advocated for controlling A. aegypti. © 2022, The

               accumulation in the subsurface, but the hydrocarbon prospects in
               this region are not well studied. We carried out an extensive
               field sampling, which included a total of 58 sediment core
               collections from an active gas seepage location and nearby areas
               at a depth of 2–2.5 m. Our sample locations are placed at 1 km

               mapped near-surface chemical alterations associated with active
               macro seepages and microseepages. The analysis of geochemical
               composition of hydrocarbon gases in the sediment indicates both
               the biogenic and thermogenic origins of seeped hydrocarbons. The
               stable isotope analysis of methane suggests the presence of
               thermogenic as well as mixed biogenic-thermogenic gases. The
               presence of such mixing of gases is caused by the secondary

               anomalous concentrations at different parts of the study area,

               We measured ozone concentrations using an ultraviolet absorption
               method and an ozone monitor. A PVC tube (inner diameter 7 mm,
               outer diameter 10 mm) was used to mimic the environment of the
               nasal cavity. The tube (790 cm) was coiled and set between two
               4-cm-thick (for X-rays) or 2-cm-thick (for electron beams)
               water-equivalent solid phantoms. The sampling tube of the ozone
               monitor was inserted into the PVC tube, and the joint was sealed
               to prevent environmental air contamination. To measure ozone
               concentrations in the atmosphere, the sampling tube supplied with
               the unit was used. A linac was used on a full-sized treatment
               field (40 cm × 40 cm at a source-to-axis distance of 100 cm). The
               effect of an electron beam on ozone concentrations was also
               evaluated with a full-sized treatment field (40 cm × 40 cm at a
               source-to-surface distance of 100 cm). Results: Ozone levels in
               the treatment room were undetectable before the start of daily
               treatment but reached 0.008 parts per million (ppm) or more at 1
               h after the start of treatment. Concentrations then remained
               nearly constant at 0.010–0.015 ppm throughout the day. The
               maximum ozone concentration in the PVC tube was only 0.006 ppm,
               even when it was irradiated at 2400 monitor units/min. Depending
               on the X-ray dose rate, the concentration increased to a maximum
               of 0.010 ppm with oxygen flowing into the other end of the tube
               at 1.5 L/min. Ozone concentrations in the PVC tube did not differ
               significantly between X-ray and electron-beam irradiation.
               Conclusions: Only traces of ozone were found in the PVC tube that
               was used to mimic the nasal passages during radiation, these
               concentrations were too low for human perception. However, ozone
               concentrations did reach potentially detectable levels in the
               treatment room. © 2022, The Author(s).",

               different culture time points, a qualitative analysis was done by
               microscopy and quantitative measurements of apoptosis, cell
               viability and IL-6 production were carried. IL-6 production by
               PVNS synovial tissue was also quantified after Cd treatment with
               or without the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-17 +

               concentrations. Cd increased the percentage of apoptotic cells

               plants and human beings. Zinc solubilizing bacteria (ZSB) could
               be a substitute for chemical Zn fertilizer. The present study
               aimed to isolate and characterize bacterial species from the
               contaminated soil and evaluate their Zn solubilizing potential.
               Zn resistant bacteria were isolated and evaluated for their MIC
               against Zn. Among the 13 isolated bacterial strains ZSB13 showed
               maximum MIC value upto 30mM/L. The bacterial strain with the
               highest resistance against Zn was selected for further analysis.
               Molecular characterization of ZSB13 was performed by 16S rRNA
               gene amplification which confirmed it as Pseudomonas oleovorans.
               Zn solubilization was determined through plate assay and broth
               medium. Four insoluble salts (zinc oxide (ZnO), zinc carbonate
               (ZnCO3 ), zinc sulphite (ZnS) and zinc phosphate (Zn3 (PO4 )2 )
               were used for solubilization assay. Our results shows 11 mm clear
               halo zone on agar plates amended with ZnO. Likewise, ZSB13 showed
               significant release of Zn in broth amended with ZnCO3 (17 and
               16.8 ppm) and ZnO (18.2 ppm). Furthermore, Zn resistance genes
               czcD was also enriched in ZSB13. In our study, bacterial strain
               comprising Zn solubilization potential has been isolated that
               could be further used for the growth enhancement of crops. ©

              the biology and complete genome sequence of the phage. Methods and
              Results: Transmission electron microscopy revealed phage pPM\_01
              to be a siphovirus (the first reported virus to infect P.
              mirabilis), with its complete genome sequence successfully
              determined. The genome was sequenced using Illumina technology and
              the reads obtained were assembled using CLC Genomic Workbench v.
              7.0.3. The whole genome contains a total of 58,546 bp of linear
              double-stranded DNA with a G+ C content of 46.9\%. Seventy
              putative genes were identified and annotated using various

              genes were defined (structural, lytic, packaging, replication,
              modification, and modulatory). The whole genome sequence showed a
              low similarity to known phages (i.e., Enterobacter phage Enc34 and
              Enterobacteria phage Chi). Host range determination and SDS-PAGE
              analysis were also performed. Conclusions: The inability to
              lysogenize a host, the absence of endotoxin genes in the annotated
              genome, and the lytic behavior suggest phage pPM\_01 as a possible

              High sensitivity is an important parameter for trace level (ppm)
              humidity sensors. Anelectronic detection circuit for interfacing
              the humidity sensor with high sensitivity requires a simple

              increasing the sensitivity include fabricating nanoporous film
              with a very large surface area. In the present work, the
              sensitivity of a parallel plate capacitive type sensor with metal
              oxide sensing film has been significantly improved with an aim to
              detect moisture from 3 to 100 ppm in the industrial process gases
              used to fabricate semiconductors and other sensitive electronic
              devices. The sensitivity has been increased by (i) fabricating a
              nanoporous film of aluminum oxide using the sol-gel method and
              (ii) increasing the cross-sectional area of a parallel plate
              capacitor. A novel double sided capacitive structure has been
              proposed where two capacitors have been fabricated-one on the top
              and one on the bottom side of a flat alumina substrat-eand then
              the capacitors are connected in parallel. The structure has twice

              time (t(c)) are determined and compared with a commercial SHAW,
              UKdew point meter. The fabricated double sided sensor has
              comparable sensitivity (S = 100\%, t(r) (s) = 28, t(c) (s) = 40)
              with the commercial meter (S = 100.5\%, t(r) (s) = 258) but has a

              double-transduction principle for silicon nanowire resonators,
              which exploits the depletion charge modulation in a junctionless
              field effect transistor body and the piezoresistive modulation. A
              mechanical resonance at the very high frequency of 100 MHz is
              detected in the drain current of the highly doped silicon wire
              with a cross-section down to ~ 30 nm. We show that the depletion
              charge modulation provides a ~ 35 dB increase in output
              signal-to-noise compared to the second-order piezoresistive
              detection, which can be separately investigated within the same

              tropospheric) sensing and then applied in nowcasting and
              forecasting research. The tomographic approach can be used to
              determine the distribution of water vapor (WV), the most active
              component of the atmosphere. WV is one of the most important
              drivers of convection and precipitation. In this method, numerous
              line-of-sight integral observations at different locations and
              directions are used to derive a 3-D distribution of a WV
              structure. One of the challenges in GNSS tomography is that
              different parameterization methods are used for computing the
              design matrix. Here, the effect of the straight-line method versus
              the ray-tracing method is investigated for computing the length of
              a ray which passes through the model element. In addition, the

              model is analyzed. The accuracy of the developed model is verified
              using radiosonde measurements in the COST benchmark dataset.
              Results show that the Eikonal ray-tracing method is superior to
              other schemes whether used with topography or not. The mean values

              high moisture content to the synthetic ester which is subjected to

              scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray
              spectroscopy (EDS), and X-Ray diffraction (XRD) to investigate
              their morphological structures, elemental composition, and crystal
              phase, respectively. Those characterizations were also confirming
              the growth of ZnO nanorods on the already-deposited graphene layer
              on fabrics. From the gas sensor measurements at room temperature,
              it was revealed that these graphene/ZnO nanocomposites were highly
              sensitive and selective towards CO gas at low concentration down
              to 10 ppm. The shortest response and recovery times of the sensors
              were measured to be 280 s and 45 s, respectively. Moreover, in
              comparison to bare graphene sensors, the surface modification by
              ZnO nanorods could obviously enhance the sensing response by up to
              40\% (i.e., doubled sensitivity). These flexible hybrid sensors
              are therefore expected to be a promising alternative for the
              existing rigid CO sensors in the market by offering unique
              nanostructures, low-cost fabrication, high flexibility, and good
              sensing performances.",

              the subject and achieved robust results by considering five

              minimization of production line disruptions due to the performance
              of suppliers, minimization of the complaints of production line

              uses precomputed look-up tables (LUTs) to enable fast and accurate
              evaluation of circuit sizing scenarios without a simulator in the

              decision making and architectural innovation that is difficult to
              attain with fully automated, black-box sizing tools. Our
              discussion begins with an overview of the LUT-based design
              paradigm and its two primary variants: inverse design (finding
              design parameters that meet the specifications) and forward

              a harsh environment, e.g., pure hydrogen and elevated humidity
              levels. A linear response in gas concentration was obtained from
              the analysis of transient sensor signal. This novel temperature
              modulation technique is more effective than an isothermal method
              where H2 background is introduced, due to the elimination of drift
              and additive noise in the sensor response that limits the
              practical utilization of these low-cost sensors.",

              non-return-to-zero (NRZ) optical link’s quarter-rate receivers is
              presented, that utilizes proxy timing recovery for fast turn-on
              time. The proxy timing recovery scheme takes advantage of
              correlated data jitter over parallel optical lanes typically
              deployed in a data-center. Rapid timing recovery of the burst-mode
              channel is enabled by incrementing/decrementing its phase rotator
              (PR) control code during idle periods using phase updates from an
              always-active channel in the link. This work also presents
              circuit-design techniques to reduce power dissipation during idle
              times while still enabling fast turn-on time. Simulated in 65 nm
              CMOS technology, the proposed CDR consumes only 19.5 mW per
              channel while operating at 10 Gbps/ch and 0.58 mW during its
              idle-state. Simulation results are presented for the turn-on time
              with the proposed technique and compared against the turn-on time
              of a conventional receiver. The proposed technique allows the CDR
              to lock within 26 unit intervals (UIs) from when it is powered on
              irrespective of a 1000 ppm frequency offset between the incoming
              data and the CDR’s reference clock. The complete CDR of each
              channel occupies an area of 0.045 mm2. The proposed scheme
              introduces only 1.3 \% of area and 2.6 \% of on-state power

  abstract = "Energy-efficient timer circuits are required in numerous
              applications for periodic operations, such as performing
              measurements and communicating data. In this paper, we present a
              gate-leakage-based timer that utilizes an amplifier-less
              replica-bias switching technique to generate a stable frequency,
              which can operate at a low supply voltage. To guarantee a stable
              oscillation frequency in a small circuit area, the proposed design
              adopts an architecture that discharges a pre-charged capacitor
              through a resistive element (gate-leaking MOS capacitor) with a
              low-leakage switch. In the proposed switching technique, the
              low-voltage timer operates by tracking the discharging terminal of
              the capacitor and biasing the reference voltage of the switch
              unit, thereby enabling the minimization of the leakage current
              without the need for analog amplifier circuits. The high supply
              sensitivity of the timer is addressed by regulating the supply
              voltage using a native NMOS header (NNH). The proposed design is
              fabricated using the 55-nm deeply depleted channel (DDC) CMOS

              systems are much lighter and more compact than standard permanent
              or superconductive magnets. However, improved designs and
              manufacturing techniques aiming at lower weight and smaller
              external size are an area of continual interest especially for
              application to space flight. Most Halbach magnet design techniques
              aim to optimize homogeneity suitable for MRI over a
              diameter-spherical volume (DSV) that requires the aspect ratio
              (length/inner diameter) to be larger than 1.5:1. Furthermore,
              current magnet construction techniques often use low-coercivity
              magnetic pieces and imperfect formers that produce a mismatch in
              the intended designs. As a result, Halbach magnets require complex
              shimming methods to improve the magnetic field homogeneity,
              causing further size and weight increase. Here, we propose to
              reduce the weight and the aspect ratio of the Halbach magnet by
              optimizing homogeneity over a cylindrical region of interest (ROI)
              rather than a DSV, applying a genetic algorithm, high-coercivity
              ferromagnets (N40UH) and a robust construction technique. The

              occurs early in ischemic stroke. However, detection of mild
              acidosis is still challenging. To enhance CEST detection for
              ischemia, we proposed a quantification approach using the residual
              of inversed Z-spectra, i.e. MTRRexVOPVP = 1/Zexp-1/Zref , where
              the reference Z-spectra Zref was calculated using our previously
              developed Voxel-wise Optimization of Pseudo Voigt Profile (VOPVP).
              Simulations were performed at two different exchange rates of
              amide, representing different pH values. Among all tested
              quantification methods, including MTRasym, Lorentzian Difference
              (LD), VOPVP residual (ZVOPVP residual), the analytical solution
              and MTRRexOPVP, MTRRexVOPVP exhibited the largest difference
              between the two exchange rates. In vivo CEST-MRI was performed at
              7 Tesla in rat brain, at 2 hours after transient ischemia by
              middle cerebral artery occlusion. Firstly, Z-spectra images were
              assessed at multiple offsets using histogram analysis, with 3.5
              and -3.5 ppm exhibiting significant changes between normal rats
              and stroke rats (n = 5 each). For all stroke rats, MTRRexVOPVP
              images (3.5 ppm) exhibited a large area of hypointensity in the
              lesion hemisphere. In contrast, MTRasym and the three-offsets
              method failed in detecting such changes, particularly for rats
              with little changes on T2w and DWI images. Among all tested
              methods, MTRRexVOPVP achieved the highest contrast-to-noise ratio
              between lesion striatum and the contralateral. For amide, amine
              and NOE, ZresidualVOPVP and MTRRexVOPVP showed significant reduced
              signals in lesions compared to the contralateral, indicating lower
              pH with slower exchange. But Z-spectra and MTRasym signal did not
              show such difference. At later time points (6 hrs and 24 hrs), all
              methods displayed contrast between two hemispheres and MTRRexVOPVP
              still show the largest contrast between the two hemisphere.
              Histology confirmed the edema and other damage in the ipsilateral

              satellite, which is equipped with a CO2-integrated path
              differential absorption (IPDA) LIDAR, in the coming years. The
              space-borne IPDA LIDAR is believed to supplement current passive
              remote sensing techniques in terms of effective observations at
              nights, as well as in high-latitude regions and heavily polluted
              areas. Currently, no LIDAR-based satellite is operational for CO2
              detection in orbit despite the fact that Active Sensing of CO2
              Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS) and Advanced
              Space Carbon and Climate Observation of Planet Earth (A-SCOPE) are
              dedicated to fill this gap. However, the ESA mission proposal
              A-SCOPE dedicated for CO2 measurement was not selected, and
              ASCENDS from NASA remains in the loop but on low priority.
              Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the feasibility
              and effectiveness of this novel technique and to identify
              potential differences among its CO2 concentration products and the
              passive remote sensing technique. In this article, we developed an
              initial data-processing procedure for an airborne CO2-IPDA LIDAR,
              which is the minified prototype of the forthcoming space-borne
              LIDAR. We tested the effectiveness of this procedure and evaluated
              the performance of the minified prototype in a flight test over
              ocean, urban, and mountainous terrain. The column-weighted xCO2
              (XCO2) retrievals obtained by the airborne IPDA LIDAR were
              considerably more sensitive to the gradients of the dry-air mixing
              ratio of CO2 (xCO2) than the XCO2 products of OCO-2 and in situ
              measurements of point xCO2. The mean XCO2 values over the ocean,
              urban, and mountainous area were 411.07, 425.71, and 417.87 ppm
              with STDs of 1.93, 0.85, and 0.96 ppm, respectively. We used
              altitude-dependent xCO2 obtained by a decline-climb flight to
              calculate a reference for XCO2 over the ocean. The difference
              between XCO2 obtained using two means was less than 0.5 ppm.
              Moreover, the actual random error coincided well with the
              simulated random error, suggesting that our previous
              performance-evaluation model was reliable. This model predicted
              that a relative random error of less than 0.3\% would be very
              likely for the forthcoming satellite mission over land. However,
              measuring CO2 concentrations precisely over oceans was identified
              as a very challenging work. Improvements in hardware technology
              are unlikely to narrow this gap largely. Thus, developing
              dedicated algorithms to address CO2 measurement over oceans by
              using IPDA LIDAR is necessary.",

              column-averaged carbon dioxide dry air mole fractions (Xco2) from
              space, provides new data sources to improve our understanding of
              carbon cycle. The available GOSAT data, however, have many gaps
              and are irregularly positioned, which make it difficult to
              directly interpret their scientific significance without further
              data analysis. Spatio-temporal geostatistical prediction approach
              can be used to fill the gaps for global and regional Xco2 mapping.
              It is important to choose a suitable spatio-temporal variogram
              model since modeling spatio-temporal correlation structure using
              variogram model is a critical step in the geostatistical
              prediction. In this study, three different flexible
              spatio-temporal variogram models, including the product-sum model,
              Cressie-Huang model, and Gneiting model, are used to model the
              spatio-temporal correlation structure of Xco2 over China, using
              the Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space retrievals of the
              GOSAT (ACOS-GOSAT) Xco2 (v3.3) data products. The three models are
              compared and evaluated using the weighted mean square errors
              (WMSE) indicating the fitness between the empirical variogram
              surface and the theoretical variogram model, cross-validation for
              quantifying prediction accuracies, and the performance of the
              three models when used to fill the spatial gaps and generate Xco2
              maps in 3-day temporal interval. The results indicate that 1) the
              model fitness of the commonly used product-sum model is slightly
              better than Cressie-Huang model and Gneiting model as indicated
              from WMSE, and 2) all the three models present similar summary
              statistics in cross-validation, all with a significantly high
              correlation coefficient of 0.92, and about 83\% of prediction
              error within 2 ppm and about 53\% within 1 ppm, and (3)
              differences between the mapping results using the three models are
              generally less than 0.1 ppm, and no significant differences can be
              identified. As a conclusion from the above results, all the three
              variogram models can precisely catch the empirical characteristics
              of the spatio-temporal correlation structure of Xco2 over China,
              and the precision and effectiveness of predicting and mapping Xco2
              using the three models are almost the same.",

              (MCP) behavior in an atmospheric homogeneous dielectric barrier
              discharge (HDBD) in helium with air impurities. From the
              simulation results, we find that the O2 Penning ionization plays a
              leading role in the discharge characteristics. As the air content
              increases from 0 ppm to 5000 ppm, the current waveforms show a
              transition from a single-pulse mode to MCP mode, and the number of
              current pulses (Np) also increases. Through analysis, we find that
              although Np increases monotonically, the evolution mechanism of
              the MCP discharges under different ranges of air content is
              different. At lower air concentration (less than 500 ppm here), we
              find the similar explanation as that reported in our previous work
              on the MCP behavior only considering N2 impurity. However, when
              the air content is higher, we find that the seed electron density
              (ne0) remains basically unchanged, not like the sharp drop at
              lower air concentration. Further analysis reveals that the rapid
              growth of direct ionization during a small period before the
              breakdown helps generate MCP discharges. In addition, the
              attachment reaction of O2 is analyzed. Results show that at higher
              air content (above 5000 ppm here), the O2 attachment reaction will
              provide more possibilities of successive ignitions after the first
              pulse with the assistance of the applied voltage, implying a
              stimulative effect of the oxygen on MCP discharges.",

              Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to detect the
              resistive and reactive changes with respect to the corresponding
              changes in the concentration of the tested solutions. Experiments

              peak at 339 nm and a neighboring region of negligible absorption
              at 336 nm as a reference. Using a modulated UV LED as a light

              specifically targeted at formaldehyde. By paying particular

              peaks of the two dyes in the wavelength domain and hence can be

              wavelength of 608 nm corresponding to the absorption peak of the
              thymol blue exhibits an exponential decrease as the CO2

              combination of three methods of data augmentations is proposed to
              solve the problem, namely swapping consonant-graphemes, flipping
              onsets, and transposing nuclei. An investigation on 50k Indonesian
              words shows that the combination of three data augmentation
              methods drastically increases the amount of both unigrams and
              bigrams. A previous procedure of flipping onsets has been proven
              to enhance the standard bigram-syllabification by relatively
              decreasing the syllable error rate (SER) by up to 18.02\%.
              Meanwhile, the previous swapping consonant-graphemes has been
              proven to give a relative decrement of SER up to 31.39\%. In this
              research, a new transposing nuclei-based augmentation method is
              proposed and combined with both flipping and swapping procedures

  abstract = "Magma volatile budgets and storage depths play a key role in
              controlling the eruptive styles of volcanoes. Volatile
              concentrations in the melt can be inferred from analyses of glass
              inclusions, which however may not be present in the investigated
              rocks or may have experienced post-entrapment processes that
              modify their volatile records. Apatite is becoming an alternative
              robust tool for unraveling the information of magmatic volatiles.
              Here we report a comprehensive dataset for the concentrations of
              volatiles and major elements in apatite crystals in the rocks from
              two eruptions with contrasting eruptive styles: the 2006
              (dome-forming) and 2010 (explosive) eruptive events at Merapi
              volcano (Java, Indonesia). We obtained two-dimensional
              compositional distributions and in situ concentrations of H2O,
              CO2, F, Cl and S in 50 apatite crystals occurring at various
              textural positions. The CO2 concentrations we report are probably
              the first ones from natural volcanic apatite. Using the volatile
              concentrations in apatite and existing thermodynamic models and
              geothermobarometers, we have calculated the volatile abundances of
              the pre-eruptive melts of the two eruptions. We find that the
              apatite from the 2006 and 2010 deposits have a similar
              compositional range of volatiles, with a bimodal distribution of
              F–H2O–CO2 contents. The apatite included in amphibole has higher
              H2O (0·9–1·0 wt \%) and CO2 (≥2400 ppm), but lower F (0·9–1·4 wt
              \%), compared to crystals included in plagioclase, clinopyroxene,
              or in the groundmass (H2O: 0·4–0·7 wt \%; CO2: 40–900 ppm; F:
              1·7–2·3 wt \%). Using these volatile concentrations and
              apatite-melt exchange coefficients we obtained two distinct ranges
              of H2O–CO2–S–F–Cl concentrations in the melt. Melts in equilibrium
              with apatite included in amphibole had 3–8 wt \% H2O, ≥8000 ppm
              CO2, 340–2000 ppm S, whereas melts in equilibrium with apatite
              included in anhydrous minerals and in the groundmass had lower H2O
              (1·5–4 wt \%), CO2 (60–2500 ppm), and S (10–130 ppm). We
              calculated the melt H2O–CO2 saturation pressures and found that
              they correspond to two main magma storage depths. The shallow
              reservoir with melts stored at ≤10 km below the crater agrees with
              the depths constrained by melt inclusions, as well as the
              geodetic, geophysical and seismic tomography studies from the
              literature. We have also found a significantly deeper melt storage
              zone at ≥25–30 km recorded by the C- and H2O-rich apatite in
              amphibole and barometry calculations using amphibole and high-Al
              clinopyroxene, which matches with the depths reported in seismic
              tomography studies. The high CO2/H2O and CO2/SO2 concentrations of
              the deep melt can help to explain the sharp increase in these
              ratios in fumarolic gas that were sampled just before the eruption
              in 2010. Supply of deep volatiles to the shallower magma column
              before the eruption in 2010 could have increased the magma
              buoyancy, and thus led to higher magma ascent rates and associated
              eruption explosivity. Evidence for the faster pre-eruptive magma
              ascent in 2010 than 2006 is also found on the diffusion distance
              of Cl in apatite microlites.",

              process to solve the challenge of the accuracy of local

              uniform photon distribution at each iteration by eliminating a
              certain number of photons. The tree is also improved to adapt to
              the complicated photon distributions. This strategy also
              facilitates the parallel elimination with a priori elimination

              because of the complex geophysical properties. With good
              performance and moderate cost, geophysical logging is considered
              to be of great potential as the compromise solution between
              seismic and core. Since the “sweet-spot” depending on the sands'
              properties are implied not in the logging “point” but “segment”,
              1D-CNN is supposed to be a better fit for reservoir
              classification: It doesn't pay too much attention to the logging
              signal sequence itself like LSTM, but focuses on feature
              extraction from the whole signals combination. Moreover, samples
              would have various sizes because of different layer thickness.
              While 1D-CNN requires all samples must be converted to a uniform
              size before input. 1D fully convolutional network (1D-FCN) can
              receive any size input of layer thickness without manually
              aligning it to the same size. For the first time in this paper,
              structures of the five networks including two fully connected

              convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) are compared and evaluated

              1D-FCN-DAF have achieved the higher area under the curve (AUC)
              with the values of 0.8889 and 0.9107 respectively in average

              topology relationship among components is very complicated.
              Therefore, designing a new PPM is quite time consuming. In order

              extensively used to detect various types of defect by monitoring
              reflected and transmitted signals because they enable faster
              screening of large areas. However, ultrasonic guided wave testing
              becomes difficult for very shallow, sharp defects as current
              inspection techniques suffer from a lack of sensitivity to such
              features. Previous studies, obtained by comparing various
              inspection techniques, suggest that the SH1 mode in particular, at
              around 3 MHz $\cdot$ mm, would be suitable when testing for
              shallow defects; however, it is clear that both the SH0 and SH1
              modes can exist at this frequency–thickness product. This can
              complicate the inspection process and, therefore, limit defect

              the reflection coefficient of the SH1 mode, the pure SH1 mode can
              be used to detect defects as shallow as 5\% thickness loss from a

              subjected to slot effects due to presence of both PM and CAW in

              which generates cogging torque (Tcog), torque ripples (Trip) and

              mobile crowdsensing (MCS) to spring up. In a typical MCS system,
              the MCS platform recruits mobile phone users (workers) to perform
              the sensing tasks published by requesters. The requesters are
              interested in some urban events and are willing to pay for the
              sensing data returned by the workers. A lot of incentive
              mechanisms have been presented in the literature, in order to
              stimulate workers to participate into MCS campaigns or to maximize
              the social welfare. However, the community has not yet paid much
              attention to optimizing the platform profit, which is highly
              valued by the profitmaking MCS organizers. In this paper, we
              consider a realistic MCS scenario that depends on probabilistic
              collaboration among workers and has constrained capacity of
              platform; and we focus on the platform profit maximization (PPM)
              in this MCS scenario. The PPM problem is NP-hard, and the key
              challenge stems mainly from the non-monotonicity caused by the
              probabilistic collaboration and the quality-based payment of the

              dedicated to design RandG, which involves a randomization policy

              bacterial memetic algorithm (BMA) is applied to solve these
              problems in two different roles, as a supervised trainer, and as
              an optimizer. As a supervised trainer, the BMA is applied to tune
              two different WBG models. The bead geometry properties (BGP) model
              follows a traditional approach providing the WBG properties as
              outputs. The direct profile measurement (DPM) model describes the
              bead profiles points by a non-linear function realized in the form

              fuzzy systems to find the solution sets of WPVs to acquire the
              desired WBG. The best performance is achieved by applying six

              amount of spatiotemporal trajectory data has been produced. One of
              the critical applications of trajectory data is location
              prediction that is important for urban traffic planning and
              location-based services. Although many methods for personal
              location prediction have been proposed, to the best of our
              knowledge, some users always have sparse historical trajectory
              data in practical applications, resulting in poor location
              prediction precision. Targeting on this challenge, we propose an
              Individual Trajectory-Group Trajectory (ITGT) location prediction
              model by utilizing the pattern of group travels. First, the model
              performs the stay point extraction and conducts the spatial
              clustering to construct the clustering link. Second, Fano's
              inequality and clustering link are used to evaluate the
              predictability of location. Third, two variable order Markov
              models, named prediction by partial match (PPM) and probabilistic
              suffix tree (PST), are adopted to predict the clustering link.
              Finally, our approach is evaluated by using 608 712 points from
              5000 volunteers at Shenzhen, China. The results show that: 1) when
              using individual trajectory, the PPM individual model is superior
              to the conventional N-order Markov model and PST individual model;
              2) when all group trajectories are used, the PPM group model is
              not as accurate as the PPM individual model; and 3) when it
              classifies the group trajectory into different traffic zones, the
              PPM zone model is better than the PPM group model and the PPM
              individual model. The prediction precision of 1-3 order PPM zone
              model is 83.21\%, 86.75\%, and 87.35\%, respectively, which
              introduces approximately 3\% performance gains by utilizing the

              gastric corpus. AIMS: To investigate the involvement of LGR5
              expression in gastric corpus ulcer regeneration in humans.
              METHODS: LGR5 expression was analyzed in five post-ESD ulcers
              during the healing process of regenerating epithelial cells of the
              gastric corpus. LGR5 expression was detected by mRNA in situ
              hybridization using an RNA scope kit. Immunohistochemistry of
              MUC6, HIK1083, and pepsinogen 1 (PG1) was performed to identify
              cell differentiation. RESULTS: We defined MUC6+/HIK1083-/PG1-,
              MUC6+/HIK1083+/PG1-, MUC6+/HIK1083+/PG1+, MUC6+/HIK1083-/PG1+, and
              MUC6-/HIK1083-/PG1+cells as pseudopyloric mucosa (PPM) phase 1

              cells (ICC), and mature chief cells (MCC) in order from the ulcer
              center, respectively. In the regenerated mucosa around post-ESD
              ulcers, LGR5 expression was observed throughout the gland in
              PPM1-PPM3, but it was limited to the bottom of the gland in ICC
              and MCC. Furthermore, LGR5 expression was not identified in the
              normal gastric corpus. The H-score of PPM2 was significantly
              higher than that of PPM3 (P = 0.0313). The H-score of PPM3 was
              significantly higher than that of ICC (P = 0.0313). The LGR5
              H-score was higher at the immature stage, which decreased
              gradually with progression of the differentiation stage.
              CONCLUSIONS: LGR5 expression appears to contribute to mucosal
              regeneration in the human gastric corpus. The application of LGR5
              expression analysis to mucosal regeneration and fundic gland-type
              gastric tumors is expected.",

              other therapeutic platforms. However, STOs must overcome several
              extracellular and intracellular obstacles to interact with their
              biological RNA targets inside cells. These obstacles include
              degradation by extracellular nucleases, scavenging by the
              reticuloendothelial system, filtration by the kidney, traversing
              the capillary endothelium to access the tissue interstitium,
              cell-surface receptor-mediated endocytic uptake, and escape from
              endolysosomal compartments to access the nuclear and/or
              cytoplasmic compartments where their targets reside. In this
              review, we present the recent advances in this field with a
              specific focus on antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and siRNA
              therapeutics.",

  abstract = "Inhalation exposure to ozone (O(3) ) causes adverse respiratory
              health effects that result from airway inflammation, a complex
              response mediated in part by changes to airway cellular
              transcriptional programs. These programs may be regulated by
              microRNAs transferred between cells (e.g., epithelial cells and
              macrophages) via extracellular vesicles (EV miRNA). To explore
              this, we exposed female C57BL/6J mice to filtered air (FA), 1, or
              2 ppm O(3) by inhalation and collected bronchoalveolar lavage
              fluid (BALF) 21 h later for markers of airway inflammation, EVs,
              and EV miRNA. Both concentrations of O(3) significantly increased
              markers of inflammation (neutrophils), injury (total protein), and
              the number of EV-sized particles in the BALF. Imagestream analysis
              indicated a substantial portion of particles was positive for
              canonical EV markers (CD81, CD51), and Siglec-F, a marker of
              alveolar macrophages. Using high-throughput small RNA sequencing,
              we identified several differentially expressed (DE) BALF EV miRNAs
              after 1 ppm (16 DE miRNAs) and 2 ppm (99 DE miRNAs) O(3) versus FA
              exposure. O(3) concentration-response patterns in EV miRNA
              expression were apparent, particularly for miR-2137, miR-126-3p,
              and miR-351-5p. Integrative analysis of EV miRNA expression and
              airway cellular mRNA expression identified EV miR-22-3p as a
              candidate regulator of transcriptomic responses to O(3) in airway
              macrophages. In contrast, we did not identify candidate miRNA
              regulators of mRNA expression data from conducting airways
              (predominantly composed of epithelial cells). In summary, our data
              show that O(3) exposure alters EV release and EV miRNA expression,
              suggesting that further investigation of EVs may provide insight
              into their effects on airway macrophage function and other
              mechanisms of O(3) -induced respiratory inflammation.",

              amphibian field guides as identification character into species.
              Sometimes, this could lead to misidentification due to different
              formulas within one species. Hydrophylax chalconotus (Anura:
              Ranidae) and Duttaphrynus melanostictus (Anura; Bufonidae) are
              common anurans species around the human activity area such as
              garden, pool, and other habitats. This research was aimed at
              describing the development of labial tooth row formula (LTRF) of
              H. chalconotus and D. melanostictus during metamorphosis.
              Specimens were taken from several locations in Sleman Regency,
              Yogyakarta Special Province. This research was done by collecting
              and rearing tadpoles from eggs into larvae. The observation was
              conducted using stereo microscope. Premetamorphosis phase (stage
              17-35) was determined based on Gosner (1960), while LTRF was
              determined based on Iskandar (1995). The LTRF development of each
              species was noted and recorded. Results show that Jirst LTRF of H.
              chalconotus could be seen from stage 25 and gradually changed into
              complex structure until stage 35. Meanwhile, first LTRF of D.
              melanostictus could be shown from the stage 24 and remain
              unchanged until stage 35. Based on the observation, it can be
              concluded that the variation of LTRF was the result of
              development, and that some differences on same stages indicating
              variation within species. Thus, it is recommended that
              identification using LTRF should also consider the stage of the
              tadpoles development. This preliminary researh should be followed
              by similar research using different species. Kewords: tadpole,

              radius of I5 km. The southern slope was known as the primary
              habitat of herpetofauna in Yogyakarta. The secondary forest area
              was known to be the most suitable habitat for herpetofauna.
              Research to enlist amphibians and reptiles in the area has been
              done by Eprilurahman and Muharromi in 2008. They reported 20
              species of amphibians and reptiles in southern slope of Merapi.
              They were 9 species of amphibians and 11 species of reptiles. The
              amphibians were belong to Family of Ranidae, Bufonidae,
              Rhacophoridae and Megophryidae. Meanwhile, the reptile were member
              of Viperidae, Scincidae, Gekkonidae, and Agamidae family. After
              2008, the research was continued in 2009 and 2010 and
              significantly added I8 new recorded species to the list. The new
              recorded species consisted of 3 species of Rhacophoridae, 1
              species of Megophryidae, 10 species of Colubridae, 1 species of
              Scincidae, 1 species of Agamidae, and 2 species of Gekkonidae.

               for which many new processes and materials are currently being
               developed. The biggest advantage is that almost any shape can be
               produced, while conventional manufacturing methods reach their
               limits. Furthermore, a lot of material is saved because the part
               is created in layers and only as much material is used as
               necessary. In contrast, in the case of machining processes, it is
               not uncommon for more than half of the material to be removed and
               disposed of. Recently, new additive manufacturing processes have
               been on the market that enables the manufacturing of components
               using the FDM process with fiber reinforcement. This opens up new
               possibilities for optimizing components in terms of their
               strength and at the same time increasing sustainability by
               reducing materials consumption and waste. Within the scope of
               this work, different types of test specimens are to be designed,
               manufactured and examined. The test specimens are tensile
               specimens, which are used both for standardized tensile tests and
               for examining a practical component from automotive engineering
               used in student project. This project is a vehicle designed to
               compete in the Shell Eco-marathon, one of the world’s largest
               energy efficiency competitions. The aim is to design a vehicle
               that covers a certain distance with as little fuel as possible.
               Accordingly, it is desirable to manufacture the components with
               the lowest possible weight, while still ensuring the required
               rigidity. To achieve this, the use of fiber-reinforced 3D-printed
               parts is particularly suitable due to the high rigidity. In
               particular, the joining technology for connecting conventionally
               and additively manufactured components is developed. As a result,

               fabricate customized tissue-engineered substitutes from
               biomaterials and cells for the repair or replacement of injured
               tissues and organs. A common challenge for 3D bioprinting
               materials is that the structures printed from the biodegradable
               polymer hydrogels tend to collapse because of the poor mechanical
               stability. In this study, dual stimuli-responsive biodegradable
               polyurethane (PU) dispersions (PUA2 and PUA3) were synthesized
               from an eco-friendly waterborne process. Acrylate group was
               introduced in the PU chain end to serve as a photosensitive
               moiety for UV-induced cross-linking and improvement of the
               printability, while mixed oligodiols in the soft segment remained
               to be the thermosensitive moiety. The photo/thermal-induced
               morphological changes of PU nanoparticles were verified by
               dynamic light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, and
               rheological measurement of the dispersions. It was observed that
               these PU nanoparticles became more rod-like in shape after UV
               treatment and formed compact packing structures upon further
               heating. With the thermosensitive properties, these UV-cured PU
               dispersions underwent rapid thermal gelation with gel moduli in
               the range 0.5-2 kPa near body temperature. The rheological
               properties of the PU hydrogels including dynamic viscoelasticity,
               creep recovery, and shear thinning behavior at 37 °C were
               favorable for processing by microextrusion-based 3D printing and
               could be easily mixed with cells before printing to produce
               cell-laden constructs. The dual-responsive hydrogel constructs
               demonstrated higher resolution and shape fidelity as well as
               better cell viability and proliferation than the thermoresponsive
               control. Moreover, the softer hydrogel (PUA3) with a low modulus
               (<1 kPa) could offer neural stem cells a tofu-like, stable, and
               inductive 3D microenvironment to proliferate and differentiate.
               We expect that the photo/thermoresponsive biodegradable
               polyurethane ink may offer unique rheological properties to
               contribute toward the custom-made bioprinting of soft tissues.

               redox couples like Mn3+/Mn2+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ exposed on Mn2O3
               surface. Herein, the catalytic activity of Mn2O3 in photothermal
               degradation of toluene was regulated by halogens including F-,
               Cl-, and Br-. As the electronegativity ordered in F (3.98) > O

               doped and Br- doped Mn2O3 in decomposing toluene. DFT theoretical
               calculation illustrates that F- attracts the shared electrons
               from Mn to itself, the deviated charge center stretches the
               adjacent Mn-O bonds and boosts the generation of abundant oxygen
               vacancies, helping to strengthen the catalytic activity of Mn2O3.

               enhanced sensitivity, improved selectivity at low temperature.
               The search for advanced gas sensing materials to efficiently
               detect NO2 gas at low temperature has much attracted the
               attention of researchers. Sensing materials with ultrasmall

               porous structure with large specific surface area is better for
               gas performance. In this study, SnO2 nanoneural network material
               composed of ultrasmall SnO2 nanoparticles (3 nm) was successfully
               obtained and has high specific surface area (96.69 m2·g−1). The

               membrane with exclusive Li+ transport channels was designed and

               polyethyleneimine (PEI) bonded with 15-crown-5 ether (15C5)
               through hydrogen interaction was selected as the aqueous monomer
               (PEI@15C5) and reacted with trimesoyl chloride (TMC). The
               channels generated by 15C5 molecules could facilitate Li+
               transport owing to their affinity to Li+. Molecular dynamics
               simulation was conducted to further confirm the Li+ transport
               through PEI@15C5-TMC membrane with exclusive Li+ transport
               channels provided by 15C5. The PEI@15C5-TMC membrane displayed a
               permeability of 8.0 L·m−2·h−1·bar−1 and stable separation factor
               (SLi,Mg) of 14, which could reduce Mg2+/Li+ mass ratio of a
               simulated brine from 20 to 1.7. Furthermore, a three-stage NF
               process was designed and performed using a PEI@15C5-TMC membrane
               to separate a simulated salt lake brine, containing multiple ions
               and Mg2+/Li+ mass ratio of 50. After the treatment, the ultimate
               permeate solution of the third stage contained 24 ppm of Li+ and
               2.7 ppm of Mg2+ with Mg2+/Li+ mass ratio of 0.1. Therefore, this
               process could be applied to obtain Li2CO3 products with high

               unique “coral-like” 3D nanostructure. The sensor based on GO/ZnO
               heterostructure exhibits a high response (42.9) towards 50 ppm
               acetone at 200 °C, fast response/recovery time (3.2/7.2 s), good
               selectivity and stability. The substantially enhanced gas sensing
               properties are primarily attributable to the unique porous
               structure of GO, plentiful oxygen vacancies and efficient
               electron mobility at the GO/ZnO heterojunction, which not only
               increases the specific surface area to provide more active sites
               for the gas adsorption, but also supplies more channels to
               facilitate the diffusion of gas molecules and favours the
               enhancement of gas detection properties. Moreover, this study can
               contribute to the realization of a porous structure of GO/ZnO
               that can be applied for the design of high performance sensing

               and 2.70 cSt). The plastic pyrolysis fuel and diesel blends were

               pyrolysis fuel blends showed about 58\% at a fuel-air equivalence
               ratio (Ф) of 0.91, which was similar to that of diesel

               to be about 1060 °C (Ф = 0.91). In addition, the flue gas
               composition of all the blends showed similar concentrations of CO

               was fabricated using the gas-flow thermal evaporation and atomic
               layer deposition method. To control the porosity of the SnO2
               matrix, Ar was introduced to the chamber to adjust the pressure
               from 0.1 to 1 Torr during thermal evaporation. Furthermore,
               nanoscale TiO2 layers were conformally deposited on the surface
               of porous SnO2 by atomic layer deposition as a selective active
               layer for HCHO. As a result, the sensor deposited at a pressure
               of 0.2 Torr showed high sensitivity and a relatively fast
               response than other deposition pressures owing to the optimized
               porosity and better electron transport. The nanoporous structure
               of SnO2 showed a high response rate of 56.7\% when exposed to CO
               with a concentration of 50 ppm and a low detection limit of 1
               ppm. The introduction of a TiO2 layer on the nanoporous SnO2
               allowed selective response to HCHO with a response rate of 20\%
               at 10 ppm when the oxidation level of the target gas was well
               aligned with the state of reactive oxygen of materials under UV

               and SnO2@TiO2 heterostructures, such as the response rate and
               response time, were assessed at different deposition pressures.
               Our results clearly show that the matching of energy levels
               between the redox energy of the target gas and the conduction
               band of the materials plays an important role in selectively
               detecting the target gas in photoactive gas sensors; therefore,

               Due to large active surface, fast charge carriers mobility and
               function-ability, carbon nanostructure is an attractive detector
               to dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), imitation of nerve agents.
               Herein, 3D carbon nanostructure is constructed via in-situ growth
               of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) on electrospun CNFs (ECNFs), then
               activated with hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) to detect DMMP via
               H-bonding. To guarantee long-term stability, a designed holder
               that allows using pieces from sensing materials is used.
               Interestingly, 3D CNFs/ECNFs-HFIP exhibits a response of 25.5–1
               ppm DMMP at room temperature (RT) under light irradiation, and
               maintains 88\% of it in a humid environment, proving stability

               exchange between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and other tissues in
               the brain and to examine the age-dependence of water exchange.
               Method: In the pulsed MISL, we implemented a short selective
               pulse followed by a post-labeling delay before an MRI acquisition
               with a long echo time; in the continuous MISL, a train of
               saturation pulses was applied. MISL signal (∆Z) was obtained by
               the subtraction of the label MRI at −3.5 ppm from the control MRI
               at 200 ppm. CSF was extracted from the mouse ventricles for the
               MISL optimization and validation. Comparison between wild type
               (WT) and aquaporin-4 knockout (AQP4−/−) mice was performed to

               age-dependence was investigated by comparing the adult and young
               WT mice. Results: The pulsed MISL method observed that the MISL
               signal reached the maximum at 1.5 s. The continuous MISL method
               showed the highest MISL signal in the fourth ventricle (∆Z =

               ventricles had similar MISL ∆Z values (∆Z = 12.0\% ± 1.8\%).
               Additionally, significantly lower ∆Z (9.3\%–18.7\% reduction) was

               young mice (p < 0.02). For the AQP4−/− mice, the ∆Z values were
               5.9\%–8.3\% smaller than those of the age-matched WT mice in the
               lateral and fourth ventricles, but were not significant.

               but on shorter time-scales large igneous provinces (LIPs) perturb
               the climate system through voluminous release of gases to the
               atmosphere. Three early Permian LIPs have been recognised
               globally, but geochronologic (283 to 276 Ma) and geochemical data
               reported here suggest a fourth, early Permian LIP (Zaduo) in
               North Qiangtang (central Tibet) that erupted at low southern
               latitudes along the eastern Tethyan margin. The late Paleozoic
               ice age (LPIA) lasted from about 330 to 260 Ma, but we argue here
               that increasing atmospheric CO2 levels and temperatures from ∼300
               Ma – contemporaneous with a fast reduction in glacial frequency –
               was spearheaded by long-lasting circum-Tethyan LIP degassing.
               This process nearly ended icehouse conditions at ∼280 Ma with
               atmospheric CO2 levels (∼800 ppm) and tropical sea surface
               temperatures near glacial inception thresholds. The middle
               Permian (275-260 Ma) is characterized by a lowering of CO2 levels
               (∼400 ppm), which partly could have been related to enhanced
               weathering of juvenile LIP-lavas on short time-scales, but major
               changes in the Tethyan paleogeography, including the opening of
               the Neotethys from ∼275 Ma, led to the increase of exposed land
               in the Tethyan tropics during the middle Permian and thus
               enhanced silicate weathering and CO2 drawdown. Both the Emeishan
               LIP (∼260 Ma) and Siberian Traps (∼252 Ma) led to extraordinary
               climate perturbations, but the transition to a Triassic
               super-greenhouse we propose is linked to the radical reduction of
               Tethyan land areas within the tropics, at a time when the Central
               Pangean tropics was aridified, and that configuration led to the
               lowest global river runoff and silicate weathering efficiency for
               the entire Phanerozoic. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",

               adsorbent with ultrahigh uranium uptake capacity and good

               facile and eco-friendly freeze-thawing strategy was explored for
               the first time to create a physically crosslinked poly(amidoxime)
               (PAO)-chitosan (CS) hybrid hydrogel (PAO@CHM) with excellent
               interfacial compatibility, superior uranium uptake capacity and
               good anti-biofouling activity. The porous 3D network architecture
               of PAO@CHM, combined with its good hydrophilicity as well as
               antibacterial property, synergistically constructs numerous
               hydrophilic and biofouling-resistant ion channels for the rapid
               diffusion of uranyl ions into the interior of the hydrogel,
               achieving maximum use of adsorption active sites on PAO@CHM.
               Consequently, superior uranium uptake capacities (743.87, 865.27,
               and 1091.53 mg g−1 for PAO fixed on hydrogel) were obtained in 8,
               16, and 32 ppm U-spiked water, respectively. Benifiting from the
               enhanced uranium adsorption activity and good antibacterial
               property, the uranium extraction capacity of PAO@CHM reached 7.46
               mg g−1 after 28 days of exposure in 500 L of natural seawater,
               which is significantly higher than that of most of adsorbents.
               The O and N atoms in amidoxime group act as main bonding sites
               for uranium uptake. The finding of this study provides a facile
               and eco-friendly strategy to construct hydrophilic and

               in non-destructive testing were investigated. The results
               demonstrated that in contrast to the texture formed when
               annealing under an Ar atmosphere, the {1 0 0} 〈0 0 1〉 texture
               formed in the recrystallized Fe-Ga thin sheets annealed with a
               flowing Ar/H2 gas mixture, resulting in a saturation
               magnetostriction of 145 ppm. This might have been related to the
               influence of the strain recrystallization rate, stored energy,
               and surface energy. The proposed magnetostrictive guided waves
               could be used for inspection using the thin sheets. In
               particular, the thin sheet annealed at 1200 °C for 2 h exhibited
               excellent guided wave sensing characteristics. This was mainly
               attributed to the formation of a cubic texture and the value of

               hrs/d (0800 to 1700) (HS-CON, HS-BMD, and HS-SYN). Treatment
               effects on footpad dermatitis and gait score were measured on 5

               (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme activities were

               SOD activities, and LTL duration on d 28 only (P < 0.05). Among
               all treatments, SYN birds had the best foot and skeletal health
               scores on both d 27 and d 41 (P < 0.05). On d 42, SYN increased
               BW, and TN-SYN birds had higher relative spleen weight than both
               TN-BMD and TN-CON birds (P < 0.05). Antibiotic BMD increased BW
               (P < 0.05) but decreased SOD activities (P < 0.05) on d 42. These
               results indicate that the SYN supplementation decreases HS

               health, while BMD improves BW but also increases oxidative stress
               in broilers. The data suggest that synbiotic supplement may

               (Ba4Nd9.33Ti18−zAl4z/3O54, BNT-A, 0 ⩽ z ⩽ 2) for comparison, the
               ceramics were prepared by a solid state method. It is found that
               Al/Nd co-doping method has a significant effect on improving the
               dielectric properties compared with Al doping. As the doping
               amount z increased, the relative dielectric constant (εr) and the
               temperature coefficient of resonant frequency (τf) of the
               ceramics decreased, and the Q×f values of the ceramics obviously
               increased when z ⩽ 1.5. Excellent microwave dielectric properties
               of εr = 72.2, Q×f = 16,480 GHz, and τf = +14.3 ppm/°C were
               achieved in BNT-AN ceramics with z = 1.25. Raman spectroscopy and
               thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) technique were
               firstly combined to analyze the structures and defects in
               microwave dielectric ceramics. It is shown that the improvement
               on Q×f values was originated from the decrease in the strength of
               the A-site cation vibration and the concentration of oxygen
               vacancies (VO⋅⋅), demonstrating the effect and mechanism
               underlying for structural and defect modulation on the

  abstract  = "Decratonic gold deposits constitute the most important type of
               gold endowment in the North China Craton (NCC), although the
               nature and evolution of ore-related fluids in these deposits
               remain controversial. Here we investigate geochemistry of
               hydrothermal zircon grains from the Dahu gold deposit in the
               Xiaoqinling region in the southern margin of the NCC. We also
               compile the published information on trace elements in
               hydrothermal zircon from deposits in the other major gold
               districts of the NCC. The zircon U-Pb data show ages in the range
               of 101–148 Ma reflecting prolonged hydrothermal alteration that
               occurred within an extensional tectonic setting. Based on the
               trace elements, three distinct groups of hydrothermal zircons are
               recognized. Group 1 shows low La contents (10), and steep
               positive LREE patterns ((Sm/La)N > 20); Group 2 possesses high La
               contents (10 ppm), low Ce/Ce* (<10), and flat LREE patterns
               ((Sm/La)N < 20). This classification is also applicable to
               orogenic and porphyry gold deposits. Group 1 grains initially
               crystallized from magma and underwent subsequent modification by
               post-magmatic fluids, whereas Group 2 and Group 3 directly
               crystallized and regrew from zirconium-saturated aqueous fluids.
               The La-enriched signature in hydrothermal zircons may mainly
               originate from undetected REE-bearing phases within zircon that
               formed during the hydrothermal alteration events. The fluid flow
               has a significant effect on the redox state of gold metallogenic
               system. The hydrothermal zircons from decratonic gold deposits
               display higher Ce/Ce* ratios (1–258) and Ce/Nd ratios (0.7–32.2)
               than those from orogenic and porphyry gold deposits, indicating
               that the zircon grains formed from a relatively oxidized fluid. ©

               important issue to prevent the possible crisis of antimicrobial

               (Eg) and the rapid charge recombination Methods: In this work, a
               surfactant-assisted sol-gel process is used to synthesize
               mesostructured ZnO nanocrystals which are subsequently loaded
               with minor amounts (1.0–4.0 wt.\%) of nanocrystalline Ag3VO4 by
               coprecipitation to form heterostructured Ag3VO4/ZnO
               photocatalyst. Significant findings: Produced nanostructures
               revealed the uniform distribution of ∼5.9 nm of monoclinic Ag3VO4
               decorating 58.6 nm wurtzite ZnO nanocrystals as confirmed by XRD,
               TEM, and XPS characterizations. In addition, the samples
               displayed a mesoporous texture with 123–150 m2 g-1 of surface
               area. The incorporation of Ag3VO4 to ZnO enhanced visible-light
               harvesting and reduced Eg from 3.34 to ∼2.4 eV. The designed
               photocatalysts showed a rapid photooxidation of ciprofloxacin
               (CPF) as an emerging antibiotic pollutant in the water. The 3.0\%
               Ag3VO4/ZnO revealed complete mineralization of 10-ppm CPF within
               45 min of visible-light irradiation at workable reusability. This
               magnificent performance is referred to as the homogenous
               distribution of Ag3VO4 on the ZnO surface that allows efficient
               separation and mobility of photoinduced charges and subsequent

               was executed to understand the heavy metal contamination in the
               urban environment using a novel multi-sample (soil, dust, and

               selected for the analysis of nine heavy metals using AAS. The
               concentration (ppm) of Cd (4.95 0.06), Zn (254.8 0), Cu (56.25
               0.06), and Mn (995.9±0.0) in the soil and Cr (135.500 0.00), Ni

               leaf samples except for Ni all the heavy metals exceeded the
               standard value. Environmental pollution indices revealed that the
               study area is mostly contaminated with Cu, Pb, Ni, Zn, Cd, Mn,
               and Cr. Vehicle emissions were recognized as the major source of

               tree leaves. However, the analysis of metals in tree leaves among
               five species Ficus aurea, Ficus benghalensis, Ficus religiosa,
               Ficus rubiginosa, and Polyalthia longifolia revealed that Ficus
               aurea is a hyperaccumulator of Cd and good accumulator for other
               metals, making it a suitable candidate for urban greening.
               Polyalthia longifolia is a better barrier of toxic elements. Cr
               possesses the highest carcinogenic risk for the inhabitants and
               Cd was found to cause the highest potential ecological risk.
               Metals in each sample type in each sampling site reveal almost a
               nonpareil relationship that indicates the appraisal of the

               simulations and Cr phantom MRI experiments were conducted at 3
               Tesla under representative CEST MR fingerprinting sampling
               scenarios, including the pseudorandomization of imaging
               parameters (e.g., saturation power B1, saturation frequency
               offset, saturation time, and relaxation time), and variation of
               the maximum saturation power B1max, B1 number, and sampling
               pattern. The CEST effect at 2 ppm was measured using asymmetry
               analysis and matched to a predefined dictionary to determine the
               pH. The pH quantification error was assessed using RMSE. Three
               metrics, namely the Cramer-Rao bound, dot product, and Euclidean
               distance, were calculated for each sampling scenario, and their
               relationships with the pH RMSE were investigated to examine their
               effectiveness for predicting the encoding capability of sampling
               schedules for pH quantification. Results: Both simulation and
               phantom studies revealed that the Cramer-Rao bound metric
               consistently exhibited superior performance for predicting the pH
               quantification error. Although dot product exhibited good
               encoding capability prediction in most sampling scenarios, it
               failed in the scenario with varied B1 numbers. In contrast,

               molecular beam epitaxy on c–Al2O3 and r–Al2O3 substrate is
               analyzed. The temperature-dependent (27–300 °C) current-voltage
               (I–V) measurements were performed for both (P–GaN \& NP–GaN)
               Schottky barrier diodes having identical device dimensions with
               Au as the metal contact. The Schottky barrier height increases
               with the increment in temperature, while vice versa was perceived
               for the ideality factor and series resistance. The I–V
               characteristics dictated that the terminal current for P–GaN is
               25 times that of NP-GaN, further corroborated by simulation
               results. The I-V curve fitting suggests the initial emission of
               charge carrier from a trapped state to a continuum of electronic
               state, following the Frenkel-Poole emission model for P-GaN. The

               (shallow and deep level) defects corresponding to VGa and ON as
               compared to the P–GaN. The sensing response obtained for the
               NP–GaN for 100 ppm CO gas at 300 °C is ~ 33\%, which is about
               seven times the response in the case of P–GaN. The role of native

               series of national environmental policies to advocate green
               development. Analysing the changes in regional atmospheric CO2
               concentrations could be more convincing in evaluating the impact
               of the associated strategies. In this study, a three-year
               continuous observation campaign of the atmospheric CO2 mole
               fraction was first conducted at the summit of the Nanling
               Mountains, southern China in 2015–2017 to probe the timely
               feedback of the implementation of the green policies of the
               government. The effects of regional emissions and removals on the
               CO2 mole fraction were subsequently analysed to explore the
               primary processes and regional contributions driving the
               background CO2 concentration. Approximately 86.4\% of the
               observed values were filtered as background events, with average
               CO2 concentrations of 395.9 ± 6.8 ppm. The curve-fitting CO2 mole
               fraction showed a slight short-term descending trend (0.6–2.2
               p.m. y−1) that was rarely seen against the backdrop of a
               continuous rise of the global average over the years. In addition
               to the possible impacts of the changes in regional-scale CO2
               sources and sinks, we inferred that the vigorously enforced
               sustainable development policies of the Chinese government should
               be accentuated to reduce CO2 emissions. Although the conclusion
               relies heavily on a relatively short dataset, this study may

               △CO concentrations above the background conditions at Lin'an

               (IOP-1), both △CO2 and △CH4 exhibited a significant increasing
               trend relative to the 2011-2019 climatological mean. The
               reduction of △CO2, △CH4 and △CO during the lockdown observational
               period (IOP-2) (which also coincided with the Chinese New Year
               Holiday) reached up to 15.0 ppm, 14.2 ppb and 146.8 ppb,
               respectively, and a reduction of △CO2/△CO probably due to a
               dramatic reduction from industrial emissions. △CO2, △CH4 and △CO
               were observed to keep declining during the post-lockdown easing
               phase (IOP-3), which is the synthetic result of lower than normal
               CO2 emissions from rural regions around LAN coupled with strong
               uptake of the terrestrial ecosystem. Interestingly, the trend
               reversed to gradual increase for all species during the later
               easing phase (IOP-4), with △CO2/△CO constantly increasing from
               IOP-2 to IOP-3 and finally IOP-4, consistent with recovery in
               industrial emissions associated with the staged resumption of
               economic activity. On average, △CO2 declined sharply throughout
               the days during IOP-2 but increased gradually throughout the days
               during IOP-4. The findings showcase the significant role of

               co-doping with different metals and nonmetals during synthesis.
               The current study was conducted to synthesize TiO2 based

               resulted in a better performance as expected. The first-order

               Research on fluoride toxicity concerning particularly on the
               skeletal muscle is scanty. We hypothesized that during skeletal
               fluorosis, along with bone, muscle is also affected, so we have
               evaluated the effects of Sodium fluoride (NaF) on mouse skeletal
               muscles. Sodium fluoride (80 ppm) was administered to 5-week-old
               C57BL6 mice drinking water for 15 and 60 days, respectively. We
               carried out histology, primary culture, molecular and proteomic
               analysis of fluoride administered mouse skeletal muscles. Results
               indicated an increase in the muscle mass (hypertrophy) in vivo
               and myotubes ex vivo by activating the IGF1/PI3/Akt/mTOR
               signalling pathway due to short term NaF exposure. The long-term
               exposure of mice to NaF caused loss of muscle proteins leading to
               muscle atrophy due to activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome
               pathway. Differentially expressed proteins were characterized and
               mapped using a proteomic approach. Moreover, the factors
               responsible for protein synthesis and PI3/Akt/mTOR pathway were
               upregulated, leading to muscle hypertrophy during the short term
               NaF exposure. Long term exposure to NaF resulted in
               down-regulation of metabolic pathways. Elevated myostatin
               resulted in the up-regulation of the muscle-specific E3
               ligases-MuRF1, promoting the ubiquitination and
               proteasome-mediated degradation of critical sarcomeric proteins.

               application. Radio frequency (RF) sputtered vanadium pentoxide
               (V2O5) film was used as the sensing layer on the biocompatible
               poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) substrate of ∼130 nm. The deposited

               elemental studies. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
               confirmed the highly stable V+5 oxidation state with the binding

               exhibited a sensor response (Ra/Rg) of 1.2 towards 5 ppm NH3 at
               room temperature. The sensing mechanism of n-type V2O5 towards

               (MeHg) exposure. The contribution of breast milk to tissue MeHg
               levels in offspring is a significant public health concern
               because breast milk contains a certain amount of MeHg. Here, the
               contribution of MeHg transferred via breast milk to the Hg levels
               in the tissues of pups (Wistar rats) was investigated. Mated
               maternal rats were fed a MeHg (2 ppm)-supplemented or a control
               diet during pregnancy. Following parturition, male neonates from
               each group were cross-fostered between exposed or control dams,
               and they were further raised by dams fed a MeHg-supplemented diet
               or a control diet during lactation. Consequently, we evaluated
               three pup groups, which were raised by dams exposed to MeHg
               during pregnancy (P pups), lactation (L pups), or pregnancy and
               lactation (PL pups). Total mercury (THg) concentrations in the
               tissues of the offspring were measured at birth (postnatal day 0
               [PD0]), during lactation (PD6, PD12, and PD19), and after weaning
               (PD29 and PD36). Blood and brain THg levels in the P and PL pups
               declined dramatically during lactation, however, there were no
               considerable differences between the two groups at PD6 and PD12.
               In contrast, blood and brain THg levels in the L pups increased
               slightly during lactation. The increase in the THg levels in the
               blood and brain of L pups at PD12 were approximately 3.3\% and
               1.5\%, respectively, compared to the corresponding THg levels in
               the neonates in the P and PL groups. Our results suggest that if
               the MeHg exposure level during pregnancy is not high enough to
               cause neuronal development defects in the fetus, the exposure via
               breast milk is not a significant concern. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",

               The field of breathomics can be split into the isolation of
               disease-specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their
               detection. In the present work, an array of five quartz tuning
               fork (QTF)-based sensors modified by polymer with nanomaterial
               additive has been utilized. The array has been used to detect
               samples of human breath spiked with ∼0.5 ppm of known VOCs
               namely, acetone, acetaldehyde, octane, decane, ethanol, methanol,
               styrene, propylbenzene, cyclohexanone, butanediol, and isopropyl
               alcohol which are bio-markers for certain diseases. Polystyrene
               was used as the base polymer and it was functionalized with 4
               different fillers namely, silver nanoparticles-reduced graphene
               oxide composite, titanium dioxide nanoparticles, zinc ferrite
               nanoparticles-reduced graphene oxide composite, and cellulose
               acetate. Each of these fillers enhanced the selectivity of a
               particular sensor towards a certain VOC compared to the pristine
               polystyrene-modified sensor. Their interaction with the VOCs in
               changing the mechanical properties of polymer giving rise to
               change in the resonant frequency of QTF is used as sensor
               response for detection. The interaction of functionalized
               polymers with VOCs was analyzed by FTIR and UV-vis spectroscopy.
               The collective sensor response of five sensors is used to
               identify VOCs using an ensemble classifier with 92.8\% accuracy
               of prediction. The accuracy of prediction improved to 96\% when

              ribosome biogenesis, thus, coupling Pol III activity to the rate
              of protein synthesis, cell growth, and proliferation. Even though
              a few Pol II-associated transcription factors have been reported
              to participate in Pol III-dependent transcription, its activation
              by activator protein 1 (AP-1) factors, c-Fos and c-Jun, has
              remained unexplored. Here, we show that c-Fos and c-Jun bind to
              specific sites in the regulatory regions of 5S rRNA (type I) and
              U6 snRNA (type III) gene promoters and stimulate their

              that endogenous AP-1 factors bind to their cognate promoter
              elements during the G1/S transition of cell cycle apparently
              synchronous with Pol III transcriptional activity. Furthermore,
              the interaction of c-Jun with histone acetyltransferase p300
              promoted the recruitment of p300/CBP complex on the promoters and
              facilitated the occupancy of Pol III transcriptional machinery via
              histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling. The findings of our
              study, together, suggest that AP-1 factors are novel regulators of
              Pol III-driven 5S rRNA and U6 snRNA expression with a potential

              have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viremia despite treatment
              with nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (nucleoside
              analogues) remains uncertain. We studied treatment with regimens
              that combined two nucleoside analogues, at least one of which was
              new, with the protease inhibitor nelfinavir, the nonnucleoside
              reverse-transcriptase inhibitor efavirenz, or both. METHODS: The
              study included 195 patients who had been treated with nucleoside
              analogues only, and had a plasma HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA level of
              at least 500 copies per milliliter. Patients were randomly
              assigned to receive, in addition to two nucleoside analogues,
              nelfinavir, efavirenz, or nelfinavir plus efavirenz. The primary
              end point was a plasma HIV-1 RNA level of less than 500 copies per
              milliliter at week 16. A secondary end point was the composite of
              the HIV-1 RNA levels measured at weeks 40 and 48. RESULTS: At week
              16 and at weeks 40 and 48, the proportions of patients in whom a
              plasma HIV-1 RNA level of less than 500 copies per milliliter was
              achieved were, respectively, 81 percent and 74 percent in the
              nelfinavir-plus-efavirenz group, 69 percent and 60 percent in the
              efavirenz group, and 64 percent and 35 percent in the nelfinavir
              group. Quadruple therapy resulted in a higher rate of viral
              suppression in both the short term (P=0.03) and the long term
              (P=0.001) than did triple therapy with nelfinavir. Triple therapy
              with efavirenz conferred a higher rate of long-term suppression
              than triple therapy with nelfinavir (P=0.004). Quadruple therapy
              also achieved a higher rate of virologic suppression than triple
              therapy with efavirenz (P=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In HIV-infected
              patients previously treated with nucleoside analogues, treatment
              with nelfinavir plus efavirenz and at least one new nucleoside
              analogue achieves a higher rate of viral suppression than do
              regimens with nucleoside analogues and nelfinavir or efavirenz

              potential novel biomarkers for various diseases. miRNAs are
              routinely measured by standard quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR);
              however, the high sensitivity of qPCR demands appropriate
              normalization to correct for nonbiological variation. Presently,
              RNU6B (U6) is used for data normalization of circulating miRNAs in
              many studies. However, it was suggested that serum levels of U6
              themselves might differ between individuals. Therefore, no
              consensus has been reached on the best normalization strategy in
              'circulating miRNA'. We analyzed U6 levels as well as levels of
              spiked-in SV40-RNA in sera of 44 healthy volunteers, 203 intensive
              care unit patients and 64 patients with liver fibrosis. Levels of
              U6 demonstrated a high variability in sera of healthy donors,
              patients with critical illness and liver fibrosis. This high
              variability could also be confirmed in sera of mice after the
              cecal ligation and puncture procedure. Most importantly, levels of
              circulating U6 were significantly upregulated in sera of patients
              with critical illness and sepsis compared with controls and
              correlated with established markers of inflammation. In patients
              with liver fibrosis, U6 levels were significantly downregulated.
              In contrast, levels of spiked-in SV40 displayed a significantly
              higher stability both in human cohorts (healthy, critical illness,
              liver fibrosis) and in mice. Thus, we conclude that U6 levels in
              the serum are dysregulated in a disease-specific manner.
              Therefore, U6 should not be used for data normalization of
              circulating miRNAs in inflammatory diseases and previous studies
              using this approach should be interpreted with caution. Further
              studies are warranted to identify specific regulatory processes of
              U6 levels in sepsis and liver fibrosis.",

               regenerative medicine and require novel safe strategies for
               translation into the clinic. A non-viral osteogenic gene
               therapeutic vector system (‘hybrid vectors’) was generated,
               combining an improved bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) gene

               miR-20-5p, miR-590b-5p), driven by the U6 promoter. The vectors
               were tested in vitro for their osteogenic differentiation
               potential in C2C12 and C3H/10T1/2 cell lines, using BMP2 alone as
               control. After confirming BMP2 expression and miRNA
               transcription, increased osteogenic differentiation was observed
               by all hybrid vectors, but most consistently by BMP2/miR-590-5p,
               using alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity assays and osteogenic
               marker mRNA quantitation, including runt-related transcription
               factor 2 (Runx2), collagen type 1 (Col1a1) and osteocalcin. To
               visualise target mRNAs of the respective miRNAs, next generation
               sequencing was performed, confirming down-regulation of mRNA
               targets of the hybrid vectors. Since the hybrid vector consisting
               of BMP2 and miR-590-5p showed the largest increase in osteogenic
               differentiation in vitro, this was tested in a mouse ectopic-bone
               model. Mineralisation was more than with BMP2 alone. The present

               plasmid system for combining therapeutic effects of recombinant
               protein expression and miRNA transcription that did not add to
               the burden of the translation machinery, while improving the
               therapeutic efficacies. In vivo proof-of-principle in the context
               of bone regeneration suggested that such hybrid vectors will be

              spliceosome disassembly involves large-scale structural
              rearrangements of U6 snRNA that are functionally important. U6
              enters the splicing pathway bound to the Prp24 protein, which
              chaperones annealing of U6 to U4 RNA to form a U4/U6 di-snRNP.
              During catalytic activation of the assembled spliceosome, U4 snRNP
              is released and U6 is paired to U2 snRNA. Here we show that point
              mutations in U4 and U6 that decrease U4/U6 base-pairing in vivo
              are lethal in combination. However, this synthetic phenotype is
              rescued by a mutation in U6 that alters a U6-Prp24 contact and
              stabilizes U2/U6. Remarkably, the resulting viable triple mutant
              strain lacks detectable U4/U6 base-pairing and U4/U6 di-snRNP.
              Instead, this strain accumulates free U4 snRNP, protein-free U6
              RNA, and a novel complex containing U2/U6 di-snRNP. Further
              mutational analysis indicates that disruption of the U6-Prp24
              interaction rather than stabilization of U2/U6 renders stable
              U4/U6 di-snRNP assembly nonessential. We propose that an essential
              function of U4/U6 pairing is to displace Prp24 from U6 RNA, and
              thus a destabilized U6-Prp24 complex renders stable U4/U6 pairing

              U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, a large ribonucleoprotein complex that
              comprises a major subunit of the assembled spliceosome. Helical
              orientations can be determined by X-ray scattering data alone, but
              the addition of NMR RDC (residual dipolar coupling) restraints
              improves the structure models. RDCs were measured in two different
              external alignment media and also by magnetic susceptibility
              anisotropy. The resulting alignment tensors are collinear, which
              is a previously noted problem for nucleic acids. Including WAXS
              data in the calculations produces models with significantly better
              fits to the scattering data. In solution, the U4/U6 di-snRNA forms
              a 3-helix junction with a planar Y-shaped structure and has no
              detectable tertiary interactions. Single-molecule Förster
              resonance energy transfer data support the observed topology. A
              comparison with the recently determined cryo-electron microscopy
              structure of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP illustrates how proteins
              scaffold the RNA and dramatically alter the geometry of the U4/U6
              3-helix junction.",

               the translational and mRNA processing (trans splicing) systems of
               trypanosomatids and other eukaryotes. In this context, certain
               small complexes of RNA and protein, which are named small nuclear
               ribonucleoproteins (U snRNPs), have an essential role in pre-mRNA

               defined in mammals, snRNPs are still not well characterized in

              mechanical nature of spin. Ensembles of many spins have found
              diverse applications ranging from magnetic resonance imaging to
              magneto- electronic devices, while individual spins are considered
              as carriers for quantum information. Read-out of single spin
              states has been achieved using optical techniques, and is within
              reach of magnetic resonance force microscopy. However, electrical
              read-out of single spins has so far remained elusive. Here we
              demonstrate electrical single-shot measurement of the state of an
              individual electron spin in a semiconductor quantum dot. We use
              spin-to-charge conversion of a single electron confined in the
              dot, and detect the single-electron charge using a quantum point
              contact; the spin measurement visibility is
              \raisebox-0.5ex\textasciitilde65\%. Furthermore, we observe very
              long single-spin energy relaxation times (up to
              \raisebox-0.5ex\textasciitilde0.85ms at a magnetic field of 8T),
              which are encouraging for the use of electron spins as carriers of
              quantum information.",

              between a default, non-catalytic conformation and a transient,
              catalytic conformation. Whereas stable interactions in the
              catalytic triplex promote catalysis and their disruptions favor
              exit from the catalytic conformation, destabilization of the lower
              ISL stem promotes catalysis and its stabilization supports exit
              from the catalytic conformation. Thus, in addition to the
              catalytic triplex, U6-ISL acts as an important dynamic component
              of the catalytic center. The relative flexibility of the lower

              found to govern excitonic properties of WZ GaN/AlN quantum dots,
              while it has a smaller effect on WZ GaN/AlGaN, and very little

              state energy in WZ GaN/AlN quantum dots, with heights larger than
              3 nm, exhibits a red shift with respect to the bulk WZ GaN energy

               responsible for the transcription of distinct subsets of genes.
               Gene-external type 3 Pol III promoters use defined transcription
               start and termination sites, and they are, therefore, widely used
               for small RNA expression, including short hairpin RNAs in RNAi
               applications and guide RNAs in CRISPR-Cas systems. We report that
               all three commonly used human Pol III promoters (7SK, U6, and H1)
               mediate luciferase reporter gene expression, which indicates Pol
               II activity, but to a different extent (H1 ≫ U6 > 7SK). We
               demonstrate that these promoters can recruit Pol II for
               transcribing extended messenger transcripts. Intriguingly,
               selective inhibition of Pol II stimulates the Pol III activity
               and vice versa, suggesting that two polymerase complexes compete
               for promoter usage. Pol II initiates transcription at the regular
               Pol III start site on the 7SK and U6 promoters, but Pol II
               transcription on the most active H1 promoter starts 8 nt upstream

               evidence for the close relationship of Pol II and Pol III

               RNA polymerase III uses a T-stretch as termination signal, but
               the exact properties have not been thoroughly investigated. Here,
               we systematically measured the in vivo termination efficiency and
               the actual site of termination for different T-stretch signals in
               three commonly used human Pol III promoters (U6, 7SK, and H1).
               Both the termination efficiency and the actual termination site
               depend on the T-stretch signal. The T4 signal acts as minimal
               terminator, but full termination efficiency is reached only with
               a T-stretch of ≥6. The termination site within the T-stretch is
               quite heterogeneous, and consequently small RNAs have a variable
               U-tail of 1–6 nucleotides. We further report that such variable
               U-tails can have a significant negative effect on the
               functionality of the crRNA effector of the CRISPR-AsCpf1 system.
               We next improved these crRNAs by insertion of the HDV ribozyme to

               Compared to shPLBr, amiR155-PLBr was expressed at a significantly
               lower level, resulting in delayed and less pronounced PLB
               silencing. Despite decreased knockdown efficiency of

               Ca2+ uptake into sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles was
               observed for both the shPLBr and amiR155-PLBr vectors. Proteomic
               analysis confirmed PLB silencing of both therapeutic vectors and
               revealed that shPLBr, but not the amiR155-PLBr vector, increased
               the proinflammatory proteins STAT3, STAT1 and activated STAT1
               phosphorylation at the key amino acid residue Tyr701.

              et al. involving a linear three-dot spin qubit, the three-dot
              charge qubit allows for less overhead on two-qubit operations. For

               among regions of Africa, Europe and Asia, and the effects of

               implications for our understanding of the present human genetic
               diversity. A crucial component of the Mediterranean world is its
               westernmost region. Clear features of transcontinental ancient
               contacts between North African and Iberian populations
               surrounding the maritime region of Gibraltar Strait have been
               identified from archeological data. The attempt to discern origin
               and dates of migration between close geographically related
               regions has been a challenge in the field of uniparental-based
               population genetics. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies have been
               focused on surveying the H1, H3 and V lineages when trying to
               ascertain north-south migrations, and U6 and L in the opposite
               direction, assuming that those lineages are good proxies for the
               ancestry of each side of the Mediterranean. To this end, in the
               present work we have screened entire mtDNA sequences belonging to
               U6, M1 and L haplogroups in Andalusians--from Huelva and Granada
               provinces--and Moroccan Berbers. We present here pioneer data and
               interpretations on the role of NW Africa and the Iberian
               Peninsula regarding the time of origin, number of founders and
               expansion directions of these specific markers. The estimated
               entrance of the North African U6 lineages into Iberia at 10 ky
               correlates well with other L African clades, indicating that U6
               and some L lineages moved together from Africa to Iberia in the
               Early Holocene. Still, founder analysis highlights that the high
               sharing of lineages between North Africa and Iberia results from
               a complex process continued through time, impairing simplistic
               interpretations. In particular, our work supports the existence
               of an ancient, frequently denied, bridge connecting the Maghreb

              Sad1 is required for pre-mRNA splicing both in vivo and in vitro,
              and its human orthologue has been shown to associate with U4/U6.U5

              tri-snRNP dissociates into U5 and U4/U6 upon ATP hydrolysis and
              cannot bind to the spliceosome. The separated U4/U6 and U5 can
              reassociate upon incubation more favorably in the absence of ATP
              and in the presence of Sad1. Brr2 is responsible for mediating
              ATP-dependent dissociation of the tri-snRNP. Our results

               seeds m−2 with common fertilizer (common) and 170 seeds m−1 with

  abstract = "U6 snRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase III (Pol III) and has an
              external upstream promoter that consists of a TATA sequence
              recognized by the TBP subunit of the Pol III basal transcription
              factor IIIB and a proximal sequence element (PSE) recognized by
              the small nuclear RNA activating protein complex (SNAPc).
              Previously, we found that SNAPc (DmSNAPc) bound to the U6 PSE can
              recruit the Pol III general transcription factor Bdp1 to form a
              stable complex with the DNA. Here, we show that DmSNAPc-Bdp1 can
              recruit TBP to the U6 promoter, and we identify a region of Bdp1
              that is sufficient for TBP recruitment. Moreover, we find that
              this same region of Bdp1 cross-links to nucleotides within the U6
              PSE at positions that also cross-link to DmSNAPc. Finally,
              cross-linking mass spectrometry reveals likely interactions of
              specific DmSNAPc subunits with Bdp1 and TBP. These data, together
              with previous findings, have allowed us to build a more
              comprehensive model of the DmSNAPc-Bdp1-TBP complex on the U6
              promoter that includes nearly all of DmSNAPc, a portion of Bdp1,
              and the conserved region of TBP.",

               relevance in macrophages and VSMCs. We used a PCR-based approach
               to rapidly identify effective siRNA target sites on mouse

              short hairpin-RNA (shRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and small guide RNA
              (sgRNA) in gene functional analysis in a variety of organisms
              including Schistosoma mansoni. However, no endogenous RNA
              polymerase III promoters have been identified in Schistosoma
              japonicum. The lack of appropriate promoters in S. japonicum has
              hindered its gene functional analysis. Identification of
              functional promoters in S. japonicum is therefore in urgent need.
              Via sequence alignment, a 347 bp sequence upstream from the coding
              region of S. japonicum U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) was
              identified, cloned, and named as S. japonicum U6 (sjU6) promoter.
              A sgRNA sequence named as sgRNA970 was designed, and its Cas9
              nuclease guiding activity was confirmed by in vitro cleavage
              assay. The sjU6 promoter was ligated with sgRNA970 coding sequence
              by overlap PCR to generate a sjU6-sgRNA970 expression cassette.
              The expression cassette was inserted into a lentiviral plasmid to
              construct the pHBLV-sgRNA970 plasmid. First, we tested the sjU6
              promoter activity in HEK293 cells by transfecting HEK293 cells
              with the pHBLV-sgRNA970 plasmid. RT-PCR amplification of the total
              RNA from the transfected HEK293 cells confirmed the presence of
              sgRNA970 transcript and indicated sjU6 promoter was functional to
              initiate transcription in HEK293 cells. Then we transduced the
              lentivirus expressing Cas9-ZsGreen fusion protein into 14 dpi
              schistosomula to test whether lentivirus was capable to induce
              exogenous gene expression in S. japonicum. Fluorescence microscopy
              and western blot results confirmed the expression of Cas9-ZsGreen
              fusion protein in S. japonicum. Therefore, this lentiviral system
              was adapted to test promoter activity in S. japonicum. Finally, we
              transduced 14 dpi S. japonicum with lentivirus produced from the
              pHBLV-sgRNA970 plasmid. RT-PCR amplification of the total RNA from
              transduced schistosomula confirmed the presence of sgRNA970
              transcript and therefore indicated sjU6 promoter was functional to
              initiate transcription in S. japonicum. To our knowledge, sjU6
              promoter would be the first identified and validated endogenous
              RNA polymerase III promoter in S. japonicum, which could be used
              for future CRISPR/Cas9 studies in S. japonicum.",

              RNA-binding motifs including a well-known and characterized
              ribonucleoprotein motif or so-called RNA recognition motif (RRM).
              In the current study, we set out to identify the RNA ligand(s) of
              a RRM-containing protein Tip110, also known as p110(nrb), SART3,
              or p110, using a RNA-based yeast three-hybrid cloning strategy.
              Six putative RNA targets were isolated and found to contain a
              consensus sequence that was identical to nucleotides 34-46 of U6
              small nuclear RNA. Tip110 binding to U6 was confirmed to be
              specific and RRM-dependent in an electrophoretic mobility shift
              assay. Both in vitro pre-mRNA splicing assay and in vivo
              splicing-dependent reporter gene assay showed that the pre-mRNA
              splicing was correlated with Tip110 expression. Moreover, Tip110
              was found in the spliceosomes containing pre-spliced pre-mRNA and
              spliced mRNA products. Nonetheless, the RRM-deleted mutant (ΔRRM)
              that did not bind to U6 showed promotion in vitro pre-mRNA
              splicing, whereas the nuclear localization signal (NLS)-deleted
              mutant ΔNLS that bound to U6 promoted the pre-mRNA splicing both
              in vitro and in vivo. Lastly, RNA-Seq analysis confirmed that
              Tip110 regulated a number of gene pre-mRNA splicing including
              several splicing factors. Taken together, these results
              demonstrate that Tip110 is directly involved in constitutive
              eukaryotic pre-mRNA splicing, likely through its binding to U6 and
              regulation of other splicing factors, and provide further evidence
              to support the global roles of Tip110 in regulation of host gene
              expression.",

               gene is a fundamental component for precursor message RNA
               (pre-mRNA) splicing and has been implicated in the etiology of
               autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP). This study aims
               to determine the consequences of knocking down Snrnp200 in
               zebrafish. Methods. Expression of the Snrnp200 transcript in
               zebrafish was determined via whole mount in situ hybridization.
               Morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) aiming to knock down the
               expression of Snrnp200 was injected into zebrafish embryos,
               followed by analyses of aberrant splicing and expression of the
               U4/U6-U5 tri-small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) components
               and retina-specific transcripts. Systemic changes and retinal
               phenotypes were further characterized by histological study and
               immunofluorescence staining. Results. Snrnp200 was ubiquitously
               expressed in zebrafish. Knocking down Snrnp200 in zebrafish
               triggered aberrant splicing of the cbln1 gene, upregulation of
               other U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP components, and downregulation of a
               panel of retina-specific transcripts. Systemic defects were found
               correlated with knockdown of Snrnp200 in zebrafish. Only
               demorphogenesis of rod photoreceptors was detected in the initial
               stage, mimicking the disease characteristics of RP. Conclusions.
               We conclude that knocking down Snrnp200 in zebrafish could alter
               regular splicing and expression of a panel of genes, which may
               eventually trigger rod defects.",

              determining their functions. Although the issue of proper miRNA
              detection was solved with the introduction of standard reverse
              transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR)
              assays, numerous issues with the selection of appropriate internal
              control genes remain. U6 (RNU6‑1) snRNA, the most commonly used
              internal control gene in miRNA RT‑qPCR assays, was shown to be
              unstable in clinical samples, particularly cancer tissues.
              Identification of the distribution of U6 in different tissues is
              the premise of more accurate quantification of miRNAs. However,
              the distribution of U6 in human carcinoma tissues and
              corresponding normal tissues is unknown. In the present study, U6
              levels were significantly higher in human breast carcinoma tissues
              compared with the corresponding normal tissues by RT‑qPCR. In the
              carcinoma or corresponding adjacent normal tissues, the expression
              levels of U6 in epithelial cells were higher than those in the
              mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, the expression levels of U6 in the

              higher than those in the adjacent normal tissues. These results
              suggest that the expression and distribution of U6 exhibits a high
              degree of variability among several types of human cells.
              Therefore, caution is required when selecting U6 as an internal
              control gene for evaluating expression profiles of miRNAs in

              applying a large spin bias, the quantum spin in a quantum dot (the

              noninvasively monitor the manipulation of the quantum spin in the

              interaction between the two dots, the polarized spin in the dot 1

               modern humans to colonize Eurasia from Africa have been proposed.
               These are the two natural passageways that connect both
               continents: the northern route through the Sinai Peninsula and
               the southern route across the Bab al Mandab strait. Recent
               archaeological and genetic evidence have favored a unique
               southern coastal route. Under this scenario, the study of the
               population genetic structure of the Arabian Peninsula, the first
               step out of Africa, to search for primary genetic links between
               Africa and Eurasia, is crucial. The haploid and maternally
               inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule has been the most
               used genetic marker to identify and to relate lineages with clear
               geographic origins, as the African Ls and the Eurasian M and N
               that have a common root with the Africans L3. Results To assess
               the role of the Arabian Peninsula in the southern route, we
               genetically analyzed 553 Saudi Arabs using partial (546) and
               complete mtDNA (7) sequencing, and compared the lineages obtained
               with those present in Africa, the Near East, central, east and
               southeast Asia and Australasia. The results showed that the
               Arabian Peninsula has received substantial gene flow from Africa
               (20\%), detected by the presence of L, M1 and U6 lineages; that
               an 18\% of the Arabian Peninsula lineages have a clear eastern
               provenance, mainly represented by U lineages; but also by Indian
               M lineages and rare M links with Central Asia, Indonesia and even
               Australia. However, the bulk (62\%) of the Arabian lineages has a
               Northern source. Conclusion Although there is evidence of
               Neolithic and more recent expansions in the Arabian Peninsula,
               mainly detected by (preHV)1 and J1b lineages, the lack of
               primitive autochthonous M and N sequences, suggests that this
               area has been more a receptor of human migrations, including
               historic ones, from Africa, India, Indonesia and even Australia,
               than a demographic expansion center along the proposed southern

              We now report the prediction of 3D structures for six RNA

              Systematic protocols for comparing models and crystal structures

              of the spliceosome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex that

              incorporation into the spliceosome, U6 is bound by the protein
              Prp24, which facilitates unwinding of the U6 internal stem-loop
              (ISL) so that it can pair with U4 snRNA. A previously reported
              crystal structure of the `core' of the U6 small nuclear
              ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) contained an ISL-stabilized A62G mutant
              of U6 bound to all four RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domains of

               mainly in terms of the heterogeneity degree in the preference

               the recently identified mRNA methylation complex containing
               METTL3, METTL14, and WTAP has been the subject of intense study.
               However, METTL16 (METT10D) has also been identified as an RNA m6A
               methyltransferase that can methylate both coding and noncoding
               RNAs, but its biological role remains unclear. While global
               studies have identified many potential RNA targets of METTL16,
               only a handful, including the long noncoding RNA MALAT1, the
               snRNA U6, as well as the mRNA MAT2A have been verified and/or
               studied to any great extent. In this study we identified/verified
               METTL16 targets by immunoprecipitation of both endogenous as well
               as exogenous FLAG-tagged protein. Interestingly, exogenously
               overexpressed METTL16 differed from the endogenous protein in its
               relative affinity for RNA targets which prompted us to
               investigate METTL16's localization within the cell. Surprisingly,
               biochemical fractionation revealed that a majority of METTL16
               protein resides in the cytoplasm of a number of cells.
               Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of METTL16 resulted in expression
               changes of a few mRNA targets suggesting that METTL16 may play a
               role in regulating gene expression. Thus, while METTL16 has been
               reported to be a nuclear protein, our findings suggest that
               METTL16 is also a cytoplasmic methyltransferase that may alter
               its RNA binding preferences depending on its cellular
               localization. Future studies will seek to confirm differences
               between cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA targets in addition to
               exploring the physiological role of METTL16 through long-term

               pastures is critical for the adequate management of grazing and
               its promotion to farmers. In this paper, machine learning models
               are developed to predict available biomass expressed as
               compressed sward height (CSH) from readily accessible
               meteorological, optical (Sentinel-2) and radar satellite data
               (Sentinel-1). This study assumed that combining heterogeneous
               data sources, data transformations and machine learning methods
               would improve the robustness and the accuracy of the developed
               models. A total of 72,795 records of CSH with a spatial
               positioning, collected in 2018 and 2019, were used and aggregated
               according to a pixel-like pattern. The resulting dataset was
               split into a training one with 11,625 pixellated records and an
               independent validation one with 4952 pixellated records. The
               models were trained with a 19-fold cross-validation. A wide range
               of performances was observed (with mean root mean square error
               (RMSE) of cross-validation ranging from 22.84 mm of CSH to
               infinite-like values), and the four best-performing models were a
               cubist, a glmnet, a neural network and a random forest. These
               models had an RMSE of independent validation lower than 20 mm of
               CSH at the pixel-level. To simulate the behavior of the model in
               a decision support system, performances at the paddock level were
               also studied. These were computed according to two scenarios:
               either the predictions were made at a sub-parcel level and then
               aggregated, or the data were aggregated at the parcel level and
               the predictions were made for these aggregated data. The results
               obtained in this study were more accurate than those found in the
               literature concerning pasture budgeting and grassland biomass
               evaluation. The training of the 124 models resulting from the
               described framework was part of the realization of a decision
               support system to help farmers in their daily decision making.",

              RNA-associated proteins, their mode of action on RNA, and their

              human RNA-associated proteins defined by ultraviolet light
              (UV)-dependent and -independent approaches, we classify these

              efficiently to RNA, and (ii) a new group of RBP-associated factors

              investigated. The Coulomb interaction between the dots is
              considered in dipole approximation. Then only the center of mass
              (c.m.) coordinates of different dots couple with each other. This
              c.m. subsystem can be solved exactly and provides magneto- phonon
              like collective excitations. The inter-dot interaction is involved
              only through a single interaction parameter. The relative
              coordinates of individual dots form decoupled subsystems giving
              rise to intra-dot excitations. As an example, the latter are
              calculated exactly for two-electron dots. Emphasis is layed on
              qualitative effects like: i) Influence of the magnetic field on
              the lattice instability due to inter-dot interaction, ii) Closing
              of the gap between the lower and the upper c.m. mode at B=0 for

              Although conserved sequence at the 3' end is not required, 2'

              activities. Although the 3' end of U6 is not required for
              recruiting Prp43p to the spliceosome, the 3' end cross-links
              directly to Prp43p in an RNA-dependent manner. Our data indicate a
              mechanism of splicing termination in which Prp43p translocates
              along U6 from the 3' end to disassemble the spliceosome and
              thereby release suboptimal substrates or excised introns. This

               conundrum. Because martian magmas are S-rich, and some trace
               metals are reported to have enhanced solubility in S-bearing
               magmas, we have carried out a series of experiments to evaluate
               the effect of high-S melts on the olivine/melt partitioning of
               Ni, Co, Mn, V, and Cr. Near-liquidus experiments on a synthetic
               primary martian mantle melt (Yamato-980459 [Y98]) were completed
               in a piston-cylinder apparatus at 0.75 GPa. Previous studies in
               S-free systems illustrate that the partition coefficients for
               these elements are dependent chiefly on DMg(Ol/melt) (the
               partition coefficient defined as wt\% Mg in olivine/wt\% Mg in
               melt, a proxy for temperature), and were used to calibrate a
               predictive expression that includes the efects of temperature
               [i.e., DMg(Ol/melt)], melt composition, and oxygen fugacity.
               These predictive expressions are then used to isolate any efect
               in DM olivine/melt due to dissolved sulfur. The results show that
               S might have a small efect for Co, but not enough to change Co
               partitioning from compatible to incompatible in our experiments.
               The addition of a sulfur term to the DCo predictive expressions
               shows that nearly 8000 ppm of sulfur would be required in the
               melt (at liquidus temperature of Y98) for DCo to become <1. These
               S contents are two times higher than those of a sulfide-saturated
               melt at the P-T conditions of a martian mantle source region.
               Therefore, the anomalous incompatible behavior observed in these
               primary magma suites must be due to another mechanism. High
               temperature, oxygen fugacity, and diffusion are not viable
               mechanisms, but magma mixing, assimilation, or kinetic
               crystallization effects remain possibilities. © 2022

              facilitate its association with U4-snRNA by intermolecular
              hydrogen bonding. RNA conformations are a key factor in
              spliceosome function, so that elucidation of changing secondary
              structures for interacting snRNAs is a subject of considerable
              interest and importance. Among the five snRNAs which participate
              in removal of spliceosomal introns, there is a growing consensus
              that U6-snRNA is the most structurally dynamic and may constitute
              the catalytic core. Previous studies by others have generated
              potential secondary structures for free U4- and U6-snRNAs,
              including the Y-shaped U4-/U6-snRNA model. These models were based
              on study of RNAs from relatively few species, and the popular
              Y-shaped model remains to be systematically re-examined with
              reference to the many new sequences generated by recent genomic
              sequencing projects. We have utilized a comparative phylogenetic
              approach on 60 diverse eukaryotic species, which resulted in a
              revised and improved U4-/U6-snRNA secondary structure. This
              general model is supported by observation of abundant compensatory
              base mutations in every stem, and incorporates more of the
              nucleotides into base-paired associations than in previous models,
              thus being more energetically stable. We have extensively sampled
              the eukaryotic phylogenetic tree to its deepest roots, but did not
              find genes potentially encoding either U4- or U6-snRNA in the and
              data-bases. Our results support the hypothesis that nuclear
              introns in these most deeply rooted eukaryotes may represent
              evolutionary intermediates, sharing characteristics of both group
              II and spliceosomal introns. An unexpected result of this study
              was discovery of a potential competitive binding site for splicing
              assembly factor RNP-4F to a 5'-UTR regulatory region within its
              own premRNA, which may play a role in negative feedback control.",
