               bumetanide in human urine samples for the detection of doping in
               sports. The method involves the use of a paper platform and
               digital image detection and is based on the reaction between
               bumetanide, p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde (p-DAC), and HCl in a
               methanolic medium, yielding a colored compound in a delimited
               area on a qualitative filter paper. The concentrations of p-DAC
               and HCl were optimized by a chemometric experimental design.
               After the addition of the reagents to the paper, digital images
               were obtained by scanning in a multifunctional printer and
               analyzed using the RGB pattern. The linear bumetanide
               concentration range was 6.90 × 10 −5 –1.37 × 10 −3 mol L −1 with
               R 2 = 0.993 and the limits of detection (LOD) and quantification
               (LOQ) were 3.60 × 10 −4 and 1.09 × 10 −4 mol L −1 , respectively.
               A SPE clean-up step for the samples were required to eliminate
               the interference of urinary urea. The recoveries obtained varied
               from 94\% to 105\%, indicating the absence of significant matrix
               effects or interferences in urine samples after clean-up step.
               The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of
               bumetanide in human urine samples. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

               various assistive robot systems including humanoid robots have
               been developed. Humanoid robotic hands are one of the most useful
               parts to assist humans efficiently. While sensing pressure or
               temperature from the robotic hands is extensively studied,
               sensing chemicals is less widely studied despite the significant
               importance. Here, a unique platform of smartly moving humanoid
               fingers actuated by chemical sensing is reported. The sensor is
               printed with disposable and biocompatible cellulose conductive
               ink materials. Rf intensity change of the sensor with NH4 +
               membrane depends on NH4 + ion concentration where R² is 0.9576.
               The smart bending motion of a finger is accomplished by logically
               programed actuation through detecting the change of interested
               ion concentration from 0.01 to 1 m at the ion-selective membrane
               electrode (ISME) sensor with resulted bending angles from 10° to
               67° accordingly. The overall signal-to-noise ratio is over 10.
               This sensing robot concept may be expanded to applications of
               microrobots which receive external stimulus, judge, and execute
               the actuation to carry out programed tasks. © 2019 WILEY-VCH

  abstract  = "Additive Manufacturing (AM) has been rapidly developing over the
               last decade. It shows great potential in reducing the need for
               energy- and resource-intensive manufacturing processes, which in
               turn reduces the amount of material required in the supply chain,
               and enables more environmentally benign practices. However, the
               question of how to realize these potential benefits has received
               little attention. This paper aims to provide an overview of the
               Sustainability of Additive Manufacturing (SAM). The context of
               the SAM is introduced, with a focus on energy and environmental
               impacts. Resource consumption is identified as the most important
               aspect. Examination from a life cycle perspective is also
               presented, with explicit discussions on opportunities to reduce
               energy and material consumption through design, material
               preparation, manufacturing, usage, and end-of-life treatment.
               Statistical data analysis provides an overview of impact
               forecasts, highlighting the importance of and need for thorough
               research on sustainability. The eco-design concept enabled by AM
               is identified as the most promising and effective technology,
               further extending and completing its design capability. This also
               determines the opportunities for energy and environmental
               optimization in subsequent processes. Most existing research is
               in process- and system-specific modeling, and few AM processes
               and systems have been studied, with generally premature
               conclusions. General models for each type of AM process are still
               necessary. Lastly, five research priorities are suggested:
               improve systematic data integration and management, correlate
               energy and quality, develop intelligent machinery, focus on
               material preparation and recycling, and discover innovative

               of 3D printing in civil engineering practices and contributed
               this technique to reach its maximum eco-friendly potentials by
               eliminating the use of Portland cement. However, inherent
               problems with 3D printing concrete lie in the low tensile
               strength and poor ductility due to non-reinforcement, which
               greatly limit the application of 3D printing materials and
               structures. Hence, this study experimentally explores the
               feasibility of directly entraining a continuous micro steel cable
               (1.2 mm) during filaments (12 mm) deposition process, forming a
               reinforced geopolymer composite material. Three different
               printing path configurations are deigned to verify the
               applicability of micro-cable reinforced geopolymer composite for
               extrusion-based 3D printing. Flexural bending capacities of the
               proposed composite is measured and evaluated through four-point
               bending test. The results prove the well bonding and coordination
               of the micro-cable and geopolymer. Significant improvement of
               mechanical strength, toughness and post-cracking deformation of
               geopolymer composite are demonstrated. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

  abstract  = "Product manufacturers are faced with a constant decrease in
               product development time, short product life cycles and an
               increase of complexity of the products. At the same time, it is
               becoming more and more difficult to justify the expected product
               features while satisfying the requirements of the trends like
               eco-design, resource efficiency, light weight design and
               individualization. These developments are key characteristics
               which favor the growing role and importance of additive
               manufacturing (AM). Additive Manufacturing techniques such as
               Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)
               or Selective Laser Melting (SLM) are transitions from building
               prototypes to manufacturing series products within short time and
               with highest requirements regarding material characteristics as
               well as product performance. Product performance is one of the
               main drivers of the creation of multi-material composites. These
               composites, existing of a matrix and embedded fibers, are more
               and more used in various industries not just the aerospace and
               automotive industry. They offer a solution to the light-weight
               requirements amongst others. Yet, so far the manufacturing of
               composites is only partially automated; it requires a lot of
               manual labor and is typically requiring tools resulting in added
               costs. A combination or integration of additive and composite
               manufacturing is very limited to not existing, being an indicator
               for the difficulties to bring these two technologies together. To
               meet this challenge the 3D Fiber Print has been developed. It is
               an AM method using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and composites
               in process simultaneously while manufacturing a product. The
               products are still manufactured layer-wise, with each layer
               containing a composite on-demand. The newly developed and
               patented print head is designed in the way that composite and
               matrix material are applied in the right setup and ration using a
               nozzle style print head to completely embed the composite. This
               paper presents the setup and possibilities of this new

               Currently, 3D printing processing technology for ceramic shaping
               generally employs laser beam, ultraviolet (UV) or visible curable
               resins to maintain shape. Here, a novel 3D printing of alumina
               ceramic parts through heat-induced DIW is developed. During the
               heat-induced solidification process, only 0.4 wt\% carrageenan is
               required to maintain the shape. The experimental results show
               that the paste displays a pseudoplastic fluid characteristic,
               which is suitable for 3D printing. The optimized heat-induced
               paste shows that when the temperature is over 65 °C, the paste
               viscosity increases sharply, resulting in a more uniform green

               manufacturing systems to replace conventional ones. Additive
               manufacturing (AM) technology, for instance, is expected to
               contribute to reducing material costs and energy consumption.
               Unlike conventional material-cutting manufacturing processes, AM
               enables designs of any shape in manufacturing by adding the
               necessary parts layer by layer. Direct energy deposition (DED) is
               one of the many AM technologies available for a variety of
               commercial steel powders such as P20, P21, SUS420, H13, D2 and
               other Non-ferrous metal powders. The DED is process that can be
               applied to various industries, like molding, medicine, and
               defense. Of these, its application to the molding industry is the
               most practical, since the process can be used to deposit

               biomass selective laser sintering (SLS) parts is limited and
               low-quality. This study aims to demonstrate the effects of the
               various processing parameters on the dimensional accuracy,
               bending strength, tensile strength, density and impact strength
               of the Prosopis chilensis/polyethersulfone (PES) composites
               (PCPCs) that were produced by SLS. The various processing
               parameters are laser power, scan speed, preheating temperature,
               scan spacing and layer thickness. In addition, the authors’
               studied the effects of PCP particle size on the mechanical
               properties of the PCPCs. Design/methodology/approach: The PCPC
               specimens were printed using an AFS SLS machine (additive
               manufacturing). The bending, tensile and impact strengths of the
               specimens were measured using a universal tensile tester. The
               dimensional accuracy of the bending specimens was determined by a
               Vernier caliper. The formability of the PCPC at various mixing
               ratios of the raw materials was earlier investigated by
               single-layer sintering experiments (Idriss et al., 2020b). The
               microstructure and particle distribution of the various PCPC
               specimens were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
               Findings: The mechanical strengths (bending, tensile and impact
               strengths and density) and the dimensional accuracy of the PCPC
               SLS parts were directly and inversely proportional, respectively,
               to the laser power and preheating temperature. Furthermore, the
               mechanical strengths and dimensional accuracy of the PCPC SLS
               parts were inversely and directly proportional, respectively, to
               the scanning speed, scan spacing and layer thickness. Practical
               implications: PCPC is an inexpensive, energy-efficient material
               that can address the drawbacks of the existing SLS parts. It is
               also eco-friendly because it lowers the pollution and CO2
               emissions that are associated with waste disposal and SLS,
               respectively. The optimization of the processing parameters of
               SLS in this study produced high-quality PCPC parts with high
               mechanical strengths and dimensional accuracy that could be used
               for the manufacture of the roof and wooden floors, construction
               components and furniture manufacturing. Originality/value: To the
               best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is among the first to
               elucidate the impact of the various SLS processing parameters on
               the mechanical properties and dimensional accuracy of the
               sintered parts. Furthermore, novel PCPC parts were produced in
               this study by SLS. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

               1980's and is still developing in a way that can be used for
               customized products with complex design and miniature features.
               Among all the available 3D printing techniques, Fused Deposition
               Modeling (FDM) is one of the most widely used technologies
               because of its capability to build different structures by
               employing various materials. However, complexity of parts made by
               FDM is greatly limited by restriction of using support materials.
               Support materials are often used in FDM for several complex
               geometries such as fully suspended shapes, overhanging surfaces
               and hollow features. This paper describes an approach to 3D print
               a structure using silicone elastomer and polylactide fiber (PLA)
               by employing a novel support material that is soluble in water.
               This support material is melted sugar which can easily be
               prepared at a low cost. Sugar is a carbohydrate, which is found
               naturally in plants such as sugarcane and sugar beets; therefore,
               it is completely organic and eco-friendly. As another advantage,
               the time for removing this material from the part is considerably
               less than other commercially available support materials and it
               can be removed easily by warm water without leaving any trace.

               (3D) net-like magnetic mesoporous carbon (MMC) by an eco-friendly
               and low-cost method. These mesoporous (3.90-7.68 nm) composites
               have a high specific surface area (287-423 m2 g-1),
               well-developed porosity (0.24-0.74 cm3 g-1) and abundant

               tissue has self-regeneration capacity upon injury, which is
               limited in the cases of volumetric muscle loss. Several
               regenerative therapies have been developed in order to enhance
               this capacity, as well as to structurally and mechanically

               biomimetic approaches that recapitulate the native
               microenvironment of the tissue in terms of parallel-aligned
               structure and biophysical signals were shown to be effective. In
               this study, we have developed 3D printed aligned and electrically
               active scaffolds in which the electrical conductivity was
               provided by carbonaceous material (CM) derived from algae-based
               biomass. The synthesis of this conductive and functional CM
               consisted of eco-friendly synthesis procedure such as
               pre-carbonization and multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)
               catalysis. CM obtained from biomass via hydrothermal
               carbonization (CM-03) and its ash form (CM-03K) were doped within
               poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) matrix and 3D printed to form
               scaffolds with aligned fibers for structural biomimicry.
               Scaffolds were seeded with C2C12 mouse myoblasts and subjected to

  abstract  = "These days’ markets are flooded with products that manufacturers
               promote as green by adding one or two green attributes to a
               conventional product. They do so take advantage of consumers’
               willingness to pay higher for green products. We examine
               consumers’ perceptions of such products through a theoretical
               lens. From a theoretical grounding we predict that: H1a: When
               consumers’ motivation to process information is high, both
               high-priced green and greenwashed products will be perceived high
               in monetary sacrifice.H1b: When consumers’ motivation to process
               information is low, in comparison to a green product, the high
               price of a greenwashed product will be perceived high in monetary
               sacrifice.H2: Perceptions of ethicality will mediate the
               evaluation of green and greenwashed products. Study 1 Sixty
               undergraduate students participated in the main study for extra
               credits. We randomly assigned participants to one of the four
               conditions in a 2 (motivation; low, high) × 2 (greenness, green,
               greenwashed) between-subjects design. The participants viewed the
               stimuli which consisted of an all-in-one printer with either one
               (greenwashed) or six (green) eco-friendly attributes and a
               fictitious brand name (Envyo) with a price of \$399.99. We
               measured perceived monetary sacrifice, willingness to purchase
               the printer as well as three covariates. Results: An ANCOVA using
               individual preference for green products as a covariate showed a
               significant motivation x greenness effect on perceived sacrifice
               (F (1, 55) = 4.75, p 0.50). In low motivation conditions, the
               perceptions of sacrifice were higher for the greenwashed printer
               (Mgreen = 5.8, Mgreenwashed = 7.0; F (1, 29) = 7.27, p < 0.05).
               Study 2a Using an implicit association task (IAT), this study
               demonstrated the implicit association of greenwashing (green)
               with unethicality (ethicality) of the firm (Greenwald, McGhee, \&
               Schwartz, 1998). Forty-three undergraduate students participated
               in the IAT task. Results: Response times were significantly
               faster in the hypothesis-consistent blocks than those in the
               hypothesis-inconsistent blocks (F (1, 39) = 41.44, p < 0.001, D =
               100). Mean response time in the hypothesis-consistent categories
               was 1295 milliseconds, compared with 1727 milliseconds in the
               hypothesis-inconsistent categories. Study 2b In this study, we
               measured ethicality concerns explicitly to test for mediation.
               Fifty-nine participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk were randomly
               assigned to one of the two conditions in a single-factor
               (greenness, green vs. greenwashed) between-subjects design. We
               used the vignettes from Study 1 to manipulate greenness and to
               create a low motivation to process information. Results from
               mediation analysis indicate that greenness significantly
               predicted ethicality (β = 1.41; 95\% CI = 0.63 to 2.20), and
               ethicality significantly predicted perceived sacrifice (β =
               −0.23; 95\% CI = −0.45 to −0.02). As expected, ethicality
               mediated the relationship between level of greenness and
               perceptions of sacrifice (indirect effect = −0.33; 95\% CI =
               −0.76 to −0.03). © 2018, Academy of Marketing Science.",

               source of O2 in engineered tissue constructs. O2
               photosynthetically produced by bioprinted algae significantly
               improved the viability and functionality of the human cells
               within surrounding matrices while reducing their hypoxic
               conditions. Fugitive patterns encapsulating the algae were
               enzymatically dissolved by cellulase digestion to create
               interconnected microchannels, which were subsequently
               endothelialized, generating vascularized tissues. © 2020 Elsevier

               A new type of biosensor for early detection of bacteriophage
               contamination is highly demanded by the milk processing market,
               and inkjet-printed electrochemical sensors could be the answer.
               Inkjet printing is a well-known technology that has been
               revisited in recent years, using silver nanoparticle (AgNP) based
               inks for low-cost and easy fabrication of sensing and biosensing
               systems on flexible and eco-compatible substrates. In this
               research, we studied inkjet printing for the manufacturing of
               both interdigitated electrodes arrays (IDEAs), and a versatile
               system to monitor bacterial cultures by electrochemical impedance
               spectroscopy (EIS). In particular, we studied this biosensing
               system for the detection of bacteriophages by comparing its
               performance with standard microbiological methods. We performed
               electrical and morphological characterizations of the devices
               produced with a consumer-use inkjet printer with commercial AgNPs
               ink on flexible substrates, such as office paper, polyethylene
               (PET), and photo paper. We used light microscopy optical
               analysis, profilometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and
               scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging to define the objects
               resolution, their real dimensions, and thickness. We also
               investigated the devices' conductivity and layout, by EIS
               measurements with a standard buffer solution, i.e., phosphate

               monitoring Lactococcus lactis cultures and bacteriophage
               infection. We compared the results to those obtained by two
               standard microbiological methods in terms of response time,

               additive manufacturing technologies, mainly in those related to
               fused deposition modelling. The versatility, reduction of
               equipment costs due to patents expiring and the great flexibility
               offered by 3D printers have driven the amazing increase of these
               technologies in the last years. On the other hand, the
               democratization of additive manufacturing also poses some issues
               regarding environment; it is important to also have into account
               the potential effects of these technologies in the environment,
               coming from energy consumption, materials, and wastes produced. A
               review of different research works dealing with environmental
               impact of additive manufacturing, such as products’ life cycle
               assessment, energy and materials consumption, and particles and
               gases releases (mainly due to health issues), has been performed.

               the upper portion of the tube is responsible for the formation of
               large snow. A minimum tube length of 30mm, onset condition, is
               needed to ensure the complete formation of agglomerated
               mechanisms with recirculation flow, and thus ensure the formation
               of considerable agglomerated particles. Results also show that
               the onset condition of agglomeration is influenced by the flow
               condition, as well as the lucking of the main flow. © 2015

               sub-lethal behavioral toxicity tests using the native Australian

               a high-resolution USB camera, user-friendly fluidic interconnects
               and miniaturized 3D-printed interface was developed. To evaluate

               perfusing toxicants through the chip-based device to dynamically
               assess the effect of toxicants on selected locomotory parameters.
               Results showed that the system was able to detect and
               automatically analyse data to assess changes in the swimming
               behavior of A.compressa at toxicant concentrations that did not
               induce mortality in test populations. For the majority of

               early and in a concentration- and exposure time-dependent manner
               and could be recorded with no “observer” input. We postulate that
               integrated Lab-on-a-Chip systems can enable new avenues for

              features of high print speed, fine image quality and environmental
              friendliness are required. Therefore the special toner also has
              been required for high speed printing and fine image quality.
              Recently many chemically prepared toners (CPTs) have been
              proposed, and these toners are suitable to achieve small and
              narrow particle size distribution. But most of these toners use
              styrene acrylic resin, and only a few toners use polyester which
              is superior to styrene acrylic resin in low-energy fusing. But due
              to the use of organic solvents in the manufacturing process,
              environmental friendliness remains a matter for improvement in
              polyester CPTs. We reported a novel PES CPT without using any
              solvent in the manufacturing process at NIP27 and NIP28. In this
              study, three technologies for advanced PES CPT were described. 1)
              To develop polyester chemically prepared toner which has larger
              fusing latitudes for full color printers, we developed a
              technology to cross-link polyester with oxazoline polymer. 2) To
              develop eco-friendly polyester chemically prepared toner for
              low-energy fusing, we tried to introduce crystalline polyester by
              emulsification in aqueous phase. It was found that crystalline
              polyester could be emulsified successfully in the presence of

              amorphous part. 3) We have found it is possible to make a toner
              having coreshell structure in which the core contains crystalline
              polyester for low-temperature fusing and the shell uses seed
              polymerization of styrene for storage stability. In this seed
              polymerization process, styrene monomer was reacted and
              cross-linked with the polyester of surface of the toner particles.
              The shell made by seed polymerization is suitable to be insoluble
              with polyester core. From this study, we could obtain a toner
              having core-shell structure in which the core contained
              crystalline polyester and the shell contained amorphous polyester
              cross-linked by styrene. Furthermore, the toner provided improved
              performance in storage stability and low-temperature fusing.

               are to create vehicles as efficient and eco-friendly as possible.
               In the automotive industry, one of the ways to achieve that is a
               reduction of the support structure weight. The solution that was
               derived from aerospace industry is monocoque support structure.
               Nevertheless, proper design of such structure is challenging,
               expensive, especially in unit production and hard to repair or
               modify in case of new subassemblies. An alternative solution for
               vehicle lightweight support structure is spatial frame created
               from carbon fibre reinforced composite tubes. A problem of such
               structure, in case of laminate composite materials, are the tubes
               connections. In classical aluminium spatial frame connections are
               welded, and therefore their strength is close to the material
               strength. In case of carbon fibre, such connections are usually
               created using adhesives, connecting carbon fibre reinforced tubes
               with composite shaped connectors or by precise cutting of the
               ends of tubes in order to increase area of contact between
               interfaces, applying adhesive and bounding tubes using composite
               materials. Another considered solution is carbon fibre tubes
               reinforced with 3D printed ribbing. Both analysis and
               optimization were conducted using HyperWorks software. The paper

               sustainability of the global environment in addition to
               minimization of production cost. The digital eco-factory has been
               proposed for a simultaneous examination of environmental
               performance, productivity and manufacturability. This paper
               entertains how to construct the digital eco-factory with high
               accuracy and usability. In general, the digital eco-factory is
               constructed on the virtual production line modelling an actual
               production line and its components. A multi-agent based
               construction of the digital eco-factory was applied and a trial
               digital eco-factory has been implemented for a PCA (Printed
               Circuit Assembly) line. A PCA line consists of a solder paste
               printer, two or three electronic part mounters, reflow soldering
               oven and testing machine. In the PCA line, processes for the
               above machines proceed in sequence, these machines' capabilities
               are modelled as individual machine agents. There are several
               types of printed boards produced, depending on the number of
               mounted electronic components and the temperature of the solder.
               When a blank PCB (Printed Circuit Board) is input to a solder
               paste printing machine, the production process is started. A PCB
               is modelled as a part agent which is one of the product agents.
               For some example virtual productions, power consumption of each
               machine on each line from the environmental view and productivity
               of each machine and each line are monitored. From the results of
               the trial implementation, it can be said that all components on
               the production line could be configured as software agents with
               required accuracy. These agents are called ``machine agents.'' In
               addition to machine agents, manufactured products such as
               workpiece and parts are also configured as software agents. ©

               construction industry has a wide range of advantages from the
               economic, social and design flexibility point of view. However,
               most of up to date research studies have been performed using
               ordinary Portland cement (OPC)-based mortars and concretes.
               Therefore, the objective of this article is to explore the
               development of an eco-friendly earth composite reinforced with
               natural sisal fibers and chemically stabilized with a hydraulic
               binder. Analysis of the workability by shear vane tests was
               performed on fresh earth samples to find the optimum water
               content in sisal fiber-reinforced earth stabilized with OPC.
               Afterward, the effect of the addition of OPC on the hardening
               process was evaluated through shear vane and Vicat needle tests
               from 0 to 180 min after mixing. The results indicate that water
               content, fiber addition and OPC replacement have a strong
               influence on the shear yield strength. Furthermore, the presence
               of chemical stabilizers as OPC accelerates the hardening process
               allowing a faster layer-by-layer deposition. This low cost and
               eco-friendly preliminary earth-based composite can be used for 3D
               printing applications in the construction industry. © Published

               fabrication. The possibilities relate not just to aspects related
               to part geometries and final applications (as is already
               happening), but also in manufacturing challenges such as the
               problem of obtaining eco-efficient and reliable supports. In this
               article, we summarize a recently developed methodology, in the
               framework of the European Union (EU) “ToMax” Project, for the
               generation of bioinspired fractal or tree-like support structures
               and provide six application examples, starting with very simple
               geometries and generalizing the process for more complex parts.

  abstract = "Plastic cards are widely used in various industries all over the
              world. Many on-demand non-embossed pictured cards require
              overcoating (also referred to as laminating) processes for surface
              protection from fading, abrasion, alteration and counterfeiting.
              There are several lamination types, such as wet lamination, dry
              lamination, hot-melt lamination and extrusion lamination. The
              focus on this paper is the hot-melt lamination type which utilizes
              heat and pressure to adhere the film on the card. The laminating /
              overcoating layer material can be clear material with
              anti-abrasion capability or hologram material for authentication.
              Typical overcoating process in the thermal transfer card printer
              is done by thermal printhead or heat roller. This paper suggests
              the heating head for this process. The heating head works on a
              very similar principle as the thermal printhead. The heating
              resistive element and temperature sensing element are placed on
              the alumina head substrate. When power is applied, the resistive
              element generates heat for the overcoating material to thermally
              adhere to the plastic card surface. Unlike the thermal printhead,
              however, which has hundreds of tiny heating elements, the heating
              head has one contiguous heating element. The construction of the
              heating head gives more robust thermal performance and even
              heating capability across the overcoating material on the card
              surface. In comparison to a heat roller, the heating head can be
              used on-demand and does not require the constant pre-heating while
              the unit is on stand-by (more ``eco-friendly'' efficiency and

               polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films was developed using a
               laser printer and a xenon flashlight at room temperature under
               ambient air conditions by imprinting a pattern onto the PET
               films. A black square pattern was laser-printed onto various
               thicknesses of PET films and subjected to flashes of different
               powers. Using black colored patterns and a certain thickness of
               PET film, the black ink created a void in the PET film in the
               form of the set pattern. To understand this phenomenon, we
               measured the light absorbance spectrum of the xenon flashlight
               using a one-millisecond sampling rate of UV-vis spectrometer.
               Furthermore, Red-Green-Blue (RGB) compositions of the printed
               colors, such as yellow, red, green, blue, and black, were
               extracted using an image color extraction tool. By investigating

               crops has aroused great public concern about the risks on the
               eco-environment resulting from a release of toxic Cry proteins
               (such as Cry1Ab) to the soil. Therefore, it is of crucial
               importance to measure the Cry proteins level and the GM crops
               content. Here, we have tested for the first time a method that
               uses novel carbon nanospheres (CNPs) label-free
               electrochemiluminescent (ECL) immunosensor for the ultrasensitive
               quantification of Cry1Ab and GM crops. In this work, novel CNPs
               were prepared from printer toner with a very facile approach, and
               linked with anti-Cry1Ab antibodies to modify a golden working
               electrode. The immunoreaction between Cry1Ab and its antibody
               formed an immunocomplex on the bioreceptor region of the sensor,
               which inhibited electron transfer between the electrode surface
               and the ECL substance, leading to a decrease of ECL response.
               Under the optimal conditions, the fabricated label-free ECL
               immunosensor determined Cry1Ab down to 3.0 pg mL−1 within a
               linear range of 0.010−1.0 ng mL−1, showing significant
               improvement of sensitivity than that of most previous reports.
               Meanwhile, the proposed method was successfully applied for GM
               rice BT63 and GM maize MON810 detections down to 0.010\% and
               0.020\%, respectively. Due to its outstanding advantages such as
               high sensitivity, ideal selectivity, simple fabrication, rapid
               detection, and low cost, the developed method can be considered
               as a powerful and pioneering tool for GM crops detection. Its use

               imprinted polymers) were able to selectively recognize AHLs,
               demonstrating a stronger fluorescence response compared with the
               corresponding CQD@NIPs (non-imprinted polymers). Under optimal
               test conditions, a good linear relationship between the
               concentration of analyte and the relative fluorescence intensity
               of the CQD@MIPs was observed. The linear detection range was
               0–2.0 μM, and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.067 μM.
               Importantly, the proposed sensing platform functioned as an
               optical detection strategy that responded quickly (2 min) to
               AHLs. Additionally, this sensing platform was applied to the
               analysis of AHLs in bacterial supernatant samples with
               satisfactory results. More interestingly, the 3D-printing
               CQD@MIPs were tentative explored in this work, which was
               personalized and portable, has an advantage of point of care
               testing (POCT) detection in the future. Based on these results,
               this detection strategy has demonstrated substantial potential
               for application in and the field of food safety. © 2020 Elsevier

               In the present paper, a form finding for a cement based
               tessellated pierced vault is studied. The multi-body rope
               approach (MRA) was used to define compression-only vault optimal
               shapes. Successively, the thrust network analysis (TNA) was
               implemented by Rhino-vault for a further validation of the shape
               and the definition of different tessellation meshes of the
               surfaces, according to different hole pattern configuration.
               Different piercing percentage of the vaults were considered and
               compared for the best solution identification. In addition, the
               geometrical solutions were analyzed by means of global stability
               analysis, taking into account the different positions of the
               holes. Furthermore, 3D printing with a Fuse Deposition Modeling

               for greater client choice and more short-run finished corrugated

               also known as additive manufacturing, could potentially reduce

               centrifugal pump impellers 3D printed using the fused filament

               dynamic properties, and the hydraulic performance of impellers
               were assessed in order to investigate how process parameters,

               which cannot meet the green and sustainable development needs of
               modern building materials. Geopolymer is an environmentally

               have low environmental load and energy consumption, which is
               expected to become a substitute for OPC. However, geopolymers

               performance improvement, potential new applicationw and
               sustainability assessment of geopolymer materials. Discussion
               from this paper showed that the properties of geopolymer
               materials, including rheology, hardening properties, toughness,
               etc., can be significantly improved by some methods such as
               chemical additives, mineral admixtures, nanoparticles, fibers,

               standard and monitored in term of deformations by the Digital
               Image Correlation techniques (DIC) in order to evaluate the

               In addition, using the HBPr and the results coming from the

               Rheological and thermal analyses are carried out to characterise

               risks associated with their degradation. Hence, a strong interest
               in biodegradable polymers of natural origin has been increasing,
               for finding alternative materials with adequate mechanical
               properties for geotechnical and geo-environmental applications.
               The main aim of this study is to test a bio-based, biodegradable
               and eco-compatible polymer, able to replace polypropylene and
               other synthetic materials in the production of geosynthetics. For
               this purpose, Poly(lactic acid) or PLA, one of the most common
               bioplastic polymer material commonly used as filament for 3D
               printers, was investigated. The chemical structure of PLA was
               determined by 1H NMR and the optical purity determination by
               polarimetry. PLA filament was used to print samples of uniaxial
               and biaxial geogrid at 1:5 scale using a professional 3D printer.
               Subsequently, tensile tests were performed on the filament and on
               prototype geogrids. Tensile tests measured a maximum tensile
               resistance of 51.96 MPa for the filament and 12.96 kN/m for
               uniaxial geogrid prototypes. The mechanical properties of PLA
               were found to be comparable to petroleum derivatives. These

               concrete (RAC) is currently available, but a systematic review
               has been lacking. This paper presents a critical review of
               chloride transport in RAC, and the induced steel corrosion
               behaviour and cracking patterns of reinforced RAC are introduced.
               Related modification methods are further discussed. The results
               showed that the incorporated recycled aggregate (RA) increased
               chloride ingress in RAC, and a time-dependent characteristic was
               observed for the chloride diffusion coefficient. The lower RA
               properties led to higher chloride ingress in preparing RAC when
               RA substitution rates were the same; the induced environmental
               damage accelerated chloride ingress in RAC. Incorporating RA
               increased the steel corrosion risk and shortened the initial
               corrosion time of reinforced RAC, and the cracking pattern of
               reinforced RAC was different from the cracking pattern of
               reinforced natural aggregate concrete. Removing and enhancing the
               adhered old mortar of RA improve the properties of RAC, and
               various modification methods can be employed to improve the
               resistance to chloride ingress and steel corrosion in RAC. In
               particular, a CO2-curing treatment, which is eco-friendly, is
               recommended for improving the RA and RAC properties. The study of

               post-treatments typically involve the use of toxic organic

               of metals is the high geometric flexibility of the processes and
               its ability to produce pilot or small batch series. In contrast,
               resource and energy intensities are often not considered as
               constraints, even though the turnout of additive manufacturing is
               high, at least compared to chip removing processes. The study at
               hand analyses the material characteristics and environmental
               impacts of a hose nozzle as an example of a commercial product of
               simple geometry. The production routes turning (conventional
               manufacturing) and laser beam melting (additive manufacturing)
               are compared to each other in terms of natural resource use,
               climate change potential and primary energy demand. It is found,
               that the product shows a lower demand for natural resources when
               produced via AM, but higher carbon emissions and energy demand
               when using a steel, that is mainly (80\%) produced from
               high-alloyed steel scrap. However, different case studies during
               the sensitivity analyses showed that a number of factors highly
               influence the results: the steel source as well as the source of
               electricity play a major role in determining the environmental
               performance of the production routes. The authors also found that
               other production processes (here cold forging of tubes) might be
               an eco-friendly alternative to both routes, if feasible from an
               economic point of view. In regard to the material
               characteristics, experimental testing revealed that the material
               advantages of AM produced hose nozzles (in particular higher
               yield strength) are reduced after a solution heat treatment is
               applied to the as-produced material, in order to increase
               corrosion resistance. However, products that do not require this
               production step might benefit from the higher yield strength, as
               a lower wall thickness could be realised. © 2019",

               selective laser sintering (SLS) and multi-jet fusion (MJF), based
               on their expected environmental impact in series production. As
               SLS already debuted in the mid-1980s, researches broadly explored
               parts' mechanical properties, energy and resource use. The
               multi-jet fusion (MJF) technology, introduced in 2017, delivers
               comparable part properties at considerably higher print speeds.
               However, its energy and resource use is still scarcely covered.
               To close this gap, this publication develops a model for

               estimation and comparison of sustainability for different use

               alternative processes have been proposed to replace them. The

               various advantages, but it needs nanoscale movement of the

               Incorporating underutilised solids and/or waste solids as
               aggregates is a way of gaining the maximum environmental and
               economic benefits from the emerging 3D concrete printing
               technology. In this study, desert sand (small size),
               river-sediment ceramsite sand (medium size), and recycled
               concrete (large size) were experimentally investigated for use as
               aggregates in the 3D printing of concrete. Three mixtures were
               designed with continuous, open, and interrupted gradations of
               solids, respectively, based on the theory of particle
               interference, and aiming to meet the requirements of
               extrusion-based 3D printing. The influences of the particle
               grading characteristics on the printability-related early-age
               behaviours, mechanical properties, and shrinkage resistance have
               been measured and analysed. The test results demonstrate that the
               self-supporting skeletal effect formed by the gradated particles
               reduces the flowability of the mixtures, but the structural
               build-up/buildability performance is improved (under the premise
               of the desired printability). The interlayer distribution and
               skeleton of the gradated aggregate contribute to improving the
               interfacial interlocking effect and contact bonding between
               layers; this is visually validated through computed tomography
               (CT) scanning. Further, the addition of aggregates reduces the
               proportion of cementitious composites, and therefore effectively
               mitigates the shrinkage of the cement matrix. The grading
               characteristics of the underutilised particle resources are
               crucial for regulating the early-age 3D printability. This
               article provides feasible solutions based on experimental data
               for promoting the eco-utilisation of underutilised and waste
               solids in 3D printing, and these solutions satisfy the minimum

               hand is proposed to replace a functionality and/or appearance of
               the missing body part. The developed design of the prosthetic

               link length ratio which were taken for designing the proposed
               prosthetic hand is referenced from a biological human hand. The
               given joint angles ensure the maximum degree of freedom of the

               when using this material in Tissue Engineering or eco-friendly
               packaging sectors. Although different PCL-based composite
               materials have been suggested in the literature and extensively
               tested in terms of processability by material extrusion additive
               manufacturing, little attention has been paid to the influence of
               the fillers on the mechanical properties of the material during
               degradation. This work analyses the possibility of tuning the
               degradation rate of PCL-based filaments by the introduction of
               microcrystalline cellulose into the polymer matrix. The enzymatic
               degradation of the composite and pure PCL materials were compared
               in terms of mass loss, mechanical properties, morphology and
               infrared spectra. The results showed an increased degradation
               rate of the composite material due to the presence of the filler
               (enhanced interaction with the enzymes). Additionally, a new
               numerical method for the prediction of the degraded geometry was
               developed. The method, based on the Monte Carlo Method in an
               iterative process, adjusts the degradation probability according
               to the exposure of each discretized element to the degradation
               media. This probability is also amplified depending on the
               corresponding experimental mass loss, thus allowing a good fit to
               the experimental data in relatively few iterations. © 2021 by the

               efficiency by eliminating the concept of waste and leading to a
               shift away from the linear take-make-waste model. In a CE,
               resources are flowing in a circular manner either in a biocycle
               (biomass) or technocycle (inorganic materials). While early
               studies indicate that 3D printing (3DP) holds substantial promise
               for sustainability and the creation of a CE, there is no
               guarantee that it will do so. There is great uncertainty
               regarding whether the current trajectory of 3DP adoption is
               creating more circular material flows or if it is leading to an
               alternative scenario in which less eco-efficient localised
               production, demands for customised goods, and a higher rate of
               product obsolescence combine to bring about increased resource
               consumption. It is critical that CE principles are embedded into
               the new manufacturing system before the adoption of 3DP reaches a
               critical inflection point in which negative practices become
               entrenched. This paper, authored by both academic and industry
               experts, proposes a research agenda to determine enablers and
               barriers for 3DP to achieve a CE. We explore the two following
               overarching questions to discover what specific issues they
               entail: (1) How can a more distributed manufacturing system based
               on 3DP create a circular economy of closed-loop material flows?
               (2) What are the barriers to a circular 3D printing economy? We
               specifically examine six areas—design, supply chains, information
               flows, entrepreneurship, business models and education—with the
               aim of formulating a research agenda to enable 3DP to reach its
               full potential for a CE. © 2016",

               biodegradable blends. These plasticizers were first tested with
               respect to their miscibility with
               Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)/Poly(lactic acid) (PHB/PLA) blends using
               a kneading machine. PHB/PLA/plasticizer blends in the weight
               ratio (wt \%) of 60/25/15 were then prepared by single screw and
               corotating meshing twin screw extruders in the form of filament
               for further three-dimensional (3D) printing. Mechanical, thermal
               properties, and shape stability (warping effect) of 3D printed
               products can be improved just by the addition of appropriate
               plasticizer to polymeric blend. The goal was to create new types
               of eco-friendly PHB/PLA/plasticizers blends and to highly improve
               the poor mechanical properties of neat PHB/PLA blends (with
               majority of PHB) by adding appropriate plasticizer. Mechanical
               properties of plasticized blends were then determined by the
               tensile test of 3D printed test samples (dogbones), as well as
               filaments. Measured elongation at break rapidly enhanced from
               21\% for neat non-plasticized PHB/PLA blends (reference) to 328\%
               for best plasticized blends in the form of filament, and from 5\%
               (reference) to 187\% for plasticized blends in the form of
               printed dogbones. The plasticizing effect on blends was confirmed
               by Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The study of
               morphology was performed by the Scanning Electron Microscopy.
               Significant problem of plasticized blends used to be also
               plasticizer migration, therefore the diffusion of plasticizers
               from the blends after 15 days of exposition to 110 °C in the
               drying oven was investigated as their measured weight loss.
               Almost all of the used plasticizers showed meaningful positive
               softening effects, but the diffusion of plasticizers at 110 °C
               exposition was quite extensive. The determination of the degree
               of disintegration of selected plasticized blend when exposed to a
               laboratory-scale composting environment was executed to roughly
               check the ``biodegradability''. © 2018 by the authors.",

               intermittent sustainable solar energy for large-scale wastewater
               purification and desalination. However, the application of solar
               steam generators is currently restricted by their high cost and
               low solar-thermal conversion efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate a
               highly efficient, portable, low cost and reusable interfacial
               solar evaporator fabricated using three-dimensional (3D) printing
               technology. Using cues from nature, the 3D-printed honeycomb
               lightweight evaporators are designed to have microporous
               capillary channels, which facilitate water transportation for
               continuous solar steam generation. The graphene coating on the
               surface enables efficient solar-to-vapor energy transfer, and a
               thermally insulating photopolymer suppresses heat loss. The
               optimized 3D-printed solar evaporator thus has a rapid
               evaporation rate of 2.67 kg m−2h−1(normalized to the projection
               area) and a high apparent solar-to-heat efficiency of 178.5\%
               under 1 sun irradiation. The device shows outstanding antifouling
               properties and hence has wide application prospects for long-term

               work in parallel with humans, making the tasks easier for them.
               Industries are frequently introducing robots on the factory floor
               for maximizing production. Competition on the market is
               motivating robot manufacturers to work out solutions where return
               on investment would take as little time as possible. End effector
               is the most important part of a robot for making specific
               operations. The end effector market has also grown and brought
               innovation in the area of grasping objects with different shapes
               with a single gripper. However, problems persist due to the need
               for a gripper, which could handle a diverse range of products for

               handling different products with a single end effector. Selecting
               a gripper for a certain application takes time and effort.
               Universal gripping solution can provide extra benefits and save

               and conductive 3D-printed platforms have been recognized as an
               emerging class of devices with high potential for
               electrochemistry. Nevertheless, as-printed electrodes provide
               poor conductivity due to the presence of high amounts of
               insulating thermoplastic material, requiring surface
               post-treatments to enhance their electrochemical performance.
               Such treatments often employ non-eco-friendly, costly, and
               time-consuming protocols. In this regard, we propose, for the
               first time, a sub-minute (around 50 s) and reagentless surface
               treatment of carbon-black/PLA-based 3D-printed electrodes using a
               Photo-Thermal approach by a CO2 laser. After the proposed
               treatment (optimized conditions: the power of 6.2\%, the scan
               rate of 20 mm s−1, and height of 10 mm), a marked improvement in
               the electrochemical electrode response (current increase and
               peak-to-peak separation) was achieved towards the detection of
               catechol, ascorbic and uric acids, paracetamol,
               hexaammineruthenium(III) chloride, and Ferri/ferrocyanide redox
               couple. The enhanced simultaneous determination of Cd2+, Pb2+,
               and Cu2+ was also demonstrated. As a proof-of-concept, the
               quantification of the adulterant paracetamol in a real seized
               cocaine sample was performed using a fully 3D-printed
               electrochemical system, and a good recovery value of 97.8\% was
               acquired. To explain all the improved results, the electrode was
               carefully characterized by imaging, spectroscopic and
               electrochemical techniques. Additionally, the between-measurement
               \% relative standard deviation (\%RSD) was 6.8\% (n = 12), while
               the between-device \%RSD was 7.5\% (n = 6) at the 1 µmol L-1
               paracetamol, indicating adequate manufacturing reproducibility.
               Thus, the strategies developed here open up new possibilities for
               applications of carbon-based 3D-printed electrodes in analytical

               components concerning energy-harvesting devices through 3D
               printing, spray and electrospinning were synthetized and tested
               for the first time. The Mg2Si fine powders were obtained through
               the combination of ball milling and thermal annealing under Ar
               atmosphere. While the latter process was crucial for obtaining
               the desired Mg2Si phase, the ball milling was indispensable for
               homogenizing and reducing the grain size of the powders. The
               synthetized Mg2Si powders exhibited a large Seebeck coefficient
               of 487 µV/K and were blended with a polymeric solution in
               different mass ratios to adjust the paste viscosity to the
               different requirements of 3D printing, electrospinning and
               low-pressure spray. The materials produced in every single stage
               of the paste synthesis were characterized by a variety of
               techniques that unequivocally prove their viability for producing
               thermoelectric parts and components. These can certainly trigger
               further research and development in green thermoelectric
               generators (TEGs) capable of adopting any form or shape with
               enhanced thermoelectric properties. These green TEGs are meant to
               compete with common toxic materials such as Bi2Te3, PbTe and CoSb
               that have Seebeck coefficients in the range of 290–700 μV/K,
               similar to that of the produced Mg2Si powders and lower than that
               of 3D printed bulk Mg2Si pieces, measured to be 4866 μV/K. Also,
               their measured thermal conductivities proved to be significantly
               lower ( 0.2 W/mK) than that reported for Mg2Si (≥ 4 W/mK).
               However, it is herein demonstrated that such thermoelectric
               properties are not stable over time. Pressureless sintering
               proved to be indispensable, but difficultly achievable by long
               thermal annealing (even above 32 h) in inert atmosphere at 400
               °C, at least for bulk Mg2Si pieces constituted by a mean grain
               size of 2–3 μm. Hence, for overcoming this sintering challenge
               and become the silicide’s extrusion viable in the production of
               bulk thermoelectric parts, alternative pressureless sintering
               methods will have to be further explored. © 2019, The Author(s).",

               protecting artificial and natural slopes against shallow
               landslides (e.g. as may be triggered by an earthquake); however,
               previous research has concentrated on individual root soil
               interaction during shear deformation rather than the global slope
               behaviour due to the extreme expense and difficulty involved in
               conducting full-scale field tests. Geotechnical centrifuge
               modelling offers an opportunity to investigate in detail the
               engineering performance of vegetated slopes, but its application
               has been restricted due to the lack of availability of suitable
               root analogues that can repeatably replicate appropriate
               mechanical properties (stiffness and strength) and realistic 3D
               geometry. This study employed 3D printing to develop a
               representative and repeatable 1:10 scale model of a tree root
               cluster (representing roots up to 1.5 m deep at prototype scale)
               that can be used within a geotechnical centrifuge to investigate
               the response of a vegetated slope subject to earthquake ground
               motion. The printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic
               root model was identified to be highly representative of the
               geometry and mechanical behaviour (stiffness and strength) of
               real woody root systems. A programme of large direct shear tests
               was also performed to evaluate the additional strength provided
               by the root analogues within soil that is slipping and
               investigate the influence of various characteristics (including
               root area ratio (RAR), soil confining effective stress and root
               morphology) on this reinforcing effect. Our results show that
               root reinforcement is not only a function of root mechanical
               properties but also depends on factors including surrounding
               effective confining stress (resulting in depth dependency even
               for the same RAR), depth of the slip plane and root morphology.
               When subject to shear loading in soil, the tap root appeared to
               structurally transfer load within the root system, including to
               smaller and deeper roots which subsequently broke or were pulled
               out. Finally, the root analogues were added to model slopes
               subjected to earthquake ground motion in the centrifuge, where it
               was revealed that vegetation can substantially reduce
               earthquake-induced slope deformation in the soil conditions
               tested (76\% reduction on crest permanent settlement during
               slippage). Both the realistic 3D geometry and highly simplified
               root morphologies, as characterised mechanically by the shear
               tests, were tested in the centrifuge which, despite exhibiting
               very different levels of additional strength in the shear tests,
               resulted in very similar responses of the slopes. This suggests
               that once a certain minimum level of reinforcement has been
               reached which will alter the deformation mechanism within the
               slope, further increases of root contribution (e.g. due to
               differences in root morphology) do not have a large further
               effect on improving slope stability. © 2017, The Author(s).",

               characterization, PLA-fused filament was successfully deposed
               onto jute fabrics to print dog-bone tensile specimens (Type I
               specimen from ASTM D638). The jute fabrics were chemically
               modified, treated with flame retardant additives, and sprayed
               with aerosol adhesive to improve the mechanical properties of
               PLA/Jute fabric composites. The elastic modulus and the strength
               of PLA were higher than PLA composites, and the plastic
               deformation of the PLA composites was slightly lower than PLA.
               Tomography scans revealed the fabrics were well oriented and some
               adherence between jute fabrics and PLA. Viscoelastic properties
               of PLA composites resulted in the reduction in storage modulus

               to segmental motions with no variations in the glass transition

               historic aviation records good examples can be found of studies
               and implementations. These cover not only new unconventional and
               disruptive aircraft configurations, but also the research and
               introduction of new materials and processes to make the airframe
               lighter and stronger. Also there have been continuous
               developments are available in the prediction of the aerodynamic
               loads that size an airplane to be safe, stable, controllable, and
               with adequate flying qualities. Today there is a growing social
               demand to minimize environmental impact in all industrial
               sectors. Our aviation industry is also under this scrutiny. This
               is the reason why new requirements are emerging as eco-
               sustainability, in addition to compliance with the safety and
               certification requirements together with the challenges of being
               global economical competitive in an increasingly demanding world.
               In this line, it is remarkable to state that aircraft fuel
               consumption, and thus emissions of carbon dioxide, is directly
               linked by three key aircraft parameters, Breguet formula related:
               weight, drag and specific consumption of the power plant. The

  abstract  = "Purpose: In the present scenario, the demand for additive
               manufacturing (AM) has increased. Taking into account
               environmental problems and sustainability, manufacturers are now
               also considering the environmental and sustainability criteria in
               their decision-making process. The sustainability concept is
               known as the triple-bottom line, namely, economic, social and
               environmental perspectives. Sustainable concept selection in the
               manufacturing organisation can be considered as the selection of
               sustainable material, product design, process, method and
               technology. This study aims to select an appropriate AM process
               by considering sustainability from various available techniques.
               Design/methodology/approach: Appropriate sustainable performance
               indicators for the AM were identified based on literature as well
               as in discussion with experts and decision-makers. The model
               addresses all the major dimensions of sustainable concepts of AM
               such as material/product quality, machine performance, market
               stability, total cost and ecological values. A hybrid
               multi-criteria decision-making approach, i.e. stepwise weight
               assessment ratio analysis and complex proportional assessment
               methods, have been used to select the best AM technique. While
               selecting criteria affecting AM machines and processes, criteria
               based on the sustainable concept are considered. Findings: Among
               the four selected AM processes, i.e. fused diffusion modelling
               (FDM), laminated object manufacturing (LOM), stereolithography
               apparatus (SLA) and selective laser sintering (SLS), the best
               alternative was found to be FDM. Research
               limitations/implications: The present study highlights some
               limitations in the selection of AM process and methodology used
               in this research. This study considers only four AM processes,
               i.e. FDM, LOM, SLA and SLS. Future work may include considering
               other AM processes and criteria that affect the sustainability of
               AM. Practical implications: The present work will help
               researchers and production managers to decide the best AM
               alternatives to fabricate desired parts. Hence, AM can help in
               maximum energy utilisation, optimal consumption of resources,
               minimum material wastage and reduction of CO2 emission.
               Originality/value: The study considers some important criteria,
               including energy consumption, eco-friendly and wastage-free
               production, that help sustainable AM. This study can result in a
               good economic efficiency of AM industries and, therefore,
               positively impact customers using green products. © 2022, Emerald

               conversion of small molecules in the production of chemical
               feedstocks and renewable fuels. The flexibility in complex and
               custom design that additive fabrication offers is potentially
               revolutionary. Numerous rapid prototyping materials and devices
               have been developed in recent years, making it timely to
               scrutinize the gaps between lab-based systems and ideal,
               industrially relevant electrocatalytic materials and devices. In
               this perspective, we define the scope of benefit of 3D printing,
               its potential, limitations, and current trends of development for
               electrocatalytic applications. We analyze future prospective
               electrodes in terms of size, printing resolution, and cost. We
               examine the strategies employed in post-processing of 3D-printed
               electrodes and in the fabrication of electrocatalytically based
               prototyping devices. We also offer our perspective on how rapid

               electrocatalytic interfaces and the electrocatalysis field in
               general. © 2019 Elsevier Inc. The application of advanced
               manufacturing techniques such as additive manufacturing, or 3D
               printing, in the production of sustainable energy devices offers
               an attractive, eco-friendly route to rapidly evolve production
               designs without the need to retool a manufacturing facility. This
               rapid prototyping approach offers promise in accelerating product
               development as well as facilitating fabrication of novel
               structures for fundamental studies in electrocatalytic
               applications. Unlike the direct impact of 3D printing in some
               other applications, the highly interdisciplinary and complex
               nature of materials, chemistry, and catalytic interfaces along
               with the scale required for electrocatalysis (and low demand for
               bespoke designs) means an extended period of research and
               development is needed to realize the full potential and scope of
               benefit of 3D printing in electrocatalysis. We envision that in
               the near term, following advances in printing technologies and
               greater understanding of properties of these printed materials,
               large-scale devices will incorporate 3D-printed components in
               concert with parts produced by more traditional means. It will,

               biodiversity and of fishery resources in the marine environment.
               An artificial reef (AR) could be a tool for protecting or
               restoring these habitats and their declining biodiversity, and
               also help to enhance sustainable fisheries. The goal is to design
               non-polluting structures that best mimic the complexity of
               natural habitats in order to improve their service to the
               community. To date, the assessment of reef performance has been
               mostly focused on fish assemblages and species of ecological
               and/or socio-economic interest, and has disregarded the biofilm
               communities that determine the first level of an AR's trophic
               network. In this work, we used biofilm formation to compare the
               quality of substrates used as building parts for an AR, in order
               to optimize an eco-friendly material that will be used to design
               a new generation of ARs produced by giant 3D printers. The
               structure of the photosynthetic communities has been identified
               using pigment biomarkers and their production of exudates has
               been analysed. These polymeric substances were quantified in
               terms of total sugar and protein concentrations. They were
               further analysed in terms of amino acid content. We found no
               significant differences between the micro-algae communities
               developed on the different substrates. These photosynthetic
               communities were mainly composed of diatoms, prasinophytes,
               haptophytes, and dinoflagellates. However, we showed that the
               material for ARs is crucial for biofilm development, especially
               with regard to its secretions of sugar. The choice of an
               appropriate substrate for AR construction is thus of particular
               importance since biofilm secretions determine the organic
               substrate on which sessile macro-organisms will settle. © 2018

               also as a supporting agent to prevent collapse of filaments
               during thermocuring, and simultaneously as a biobased nanofiller
               to reinforce scaffolds. The rheological analyses showed the
               pre-POFC/ChiNC inks fulfilled the requirements for DIW printing.

  abstract  = "Establishment of a closed loop supply chain (CLSC) network has
               attracted immense significance due to government policies and
               societal demand for environmental consciousness. However, to
               enhance the financial and ecological impact of the network, the
               forward and reverse supply chain networks must integrate well so
               that decisions taken in both areas complement each other. In this
               study, we propose an eco-efficient CLSC design for extending the
               existing supply chain of an Indian firm that assembles inkjet
               printers. The network design is configured as a multi-objective
               model in a multi-period setting and is mathematically formulated
               into a mixed integer programming problem with fuzzy objectives.
               Fuzziness provides flexibility to the decision makers because
               they must accommodate the conflicting nature of the objectives.
               The fuzzy multi-objective model incorporates the firm's economic
               and environmental concerns into the decision making process by
               selecting environmentally responsible suppliers to procure
               components based on sustainable criteria, choosing appropriate
               recovery options for end-of-use (EOU) inkjet printers, and
               planning an efficient transportation network design for reducing
               the carbon emission of the distribution and collection
               activities. The uniqueness of the proposed fuzzy CLSC
               optimization model lies in providing an integrated decision
               making framework that can aid the manufacturer in making crucial
               strategic, tactical, and operational decisions of optimal
               selection of suppliers, component order allocation, recovery flow
               allocation, and vehicle routing planning. The novelty of the
               model also lies in simultaneously minimising the overall cost of
               the activities undertaken, maximizing the performance of the
               component suppliers and minimising the carbon emissions of the
               associated transportation activities. A weighted fuzzy
               mathematical programming approach is utilised for generating a
               fuzzy, properly efficient solution as the desired compromised
               solution for the CLSC network problem configuration. The
               relevance of the model is justified using a real data set derived
               from a case study of the firm based in the northern capital
               region (NCR) of India. The findings indicate that the proposed
               integrated CLSC network model enables the firm in gaining
               sustainably from the numerous electronic product reuse
               opportunities in the Indian market. Further, while costly to
               begin with, choosing suppliers with higher sustainable
               performance and vehicles with lesser emission rate could
               substantially enhance firm's sustainable image and result in
               higher profits in the future. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

               the tests and more importantly to collect experimental readouts.
               Moreover, static test procedures offer poor control of water
               parameters such as toxicant concentration and dissolved oxygen,
               which are important considerations in evaluating environmental
               impacts of aquatic pollution. So far only minimal levels of
               automation have been adopted in ecotoxicology. Our current work
               attempts to address the current limitations by capitalizing on
               latest advances in microfluidics, 3D printing and laser
               micromachining technologies to develop highly customized, low
               cost and high-throughput devices. Here we for the first time
               introduce a proof-of-concept laboratory automation system to
               perform ecotoxicity tests on the marine amphipod Allorchestes
               compressa in a microfluidic environment. Our innovative system
               incorporated a microperfusion Lab-on-a-Chip device that enabled
               the biotests to be run in both closed- or open-loop regimens.
               Miniaturized video cameras were utilized to monitor the amphipods
               movement patterns during the experiments. Furthermore innovative
               video analysis algorithms was applied for detection of sub-lethal
               endpoints such as changes in swimming activity that would
               otherwise go unnoticed. A key advantage of this flow-through
               system as compared to conventional approach is the automation of
               analysis and emphasis on sub-lethal behavioral parameters. We

               time-series and then processed to obtain the appliances’

               help us to improve these factors. To prepare a model to help
               predict the implementation of the GSCM, a questionnaire was

               developed following a survey consisting of responses from key
               elements of the supply chain management hierarchy. Most important
               variables included technology, policies and the average length of

  abstract  = "Silk fibroin (SF) is a natural protein polymer that can be
               extracted from B. mori silkworm cocoons. It has been used by the
               textile industry for thousands of years. With increasing needs
               for implantable and degradable biomaterials, SF textile material
               has attracted more and more interests in the biomedical field,
               due to its excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability,
               non-immunogenicity and sufficient supply. Moreover, it can be
               combined with other biomaterials to form biopolymer composites
               with unique performance. The versatility and sustainability of SF
               fibers-based biomedical textile material provides new research
               ideas and solutions for tailoring biomaterials to meet specific
               biomedical applications via eco-friendly approaches. The natural
               SF fiber can be obtained by degumming the cocoons, and after
               being dissolved, the regenerated SF solution can be obtained.
               Then, the regenerated SF solution can further prepare the
               regenerated SF fiber by different molding methods. According to
               the practical application requirements in the field of
               biomedicine, SF fibers can be made into one-dimensional,
               two-dimensional or three-dimensional biomedical textiles by
               various techniques such as weaving, knitting, non-woven,
               electrospinning and three-dimensional printing technology, which
               have broad application prospects in biomedical fields such as
               tissue engineering, drug delivery and biosensors. However, there
               are still some disadvantages in the mechanical properties and
               persistence of SF textile materials, beyond that the specific
               biofunctionality is not excellent such as blood solubility, cell
               adhesion, osseointegration and cell differentiation. Therefore,
               the application of silk fibroin textile materials in the
               biomedical field is limited to some extent. In order to expand
               the application of SF textile materials in the biomedical field,
               it is usually necessary to enhance the inherent function or
               introduce new functions of SF textile materials through
               functional modification while retaining its intrinsic properties.
               At present, there are four main methods for functional
               modification of SF materials, including intrinsic functional
               modification, surface modification of SF fiber, blending
               modification with other functional fiber, directly mixing before
               regenerated SF solution spinning. The functionally modified SF
               materials can effectively guide cell response and functional
               expression, enhance mechanical properties, and achieve the
               purpose of promoting wound healing and tissue organ repair. This
               paper mainly reviews the recent advances in the development of
               one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three-dimensional SF-based
               textile materials in the biomedical fields. And the structure and
               basic properties of SF materials are introduced, the functional
               modification methods of SF-based textile materials are
               summarized. Besides, the future development tendency of SF-based
               textile materials is also forecasted. © 2020, Materials Review

               data disclose that in the 1980s, 400-800 watts per square metre
               was typical; during the heyday of the dotcoms, it was 750-1000

               Accompanying the rapid developments of graphene, it is highly
               important to explore graphene based bio-functional nanostructures
               (G-BFNs)to bridge the gap between the fundamental advantages of

               recent advancements in fabricating G-BFNs for advanced biological
               and cellular interfaces. We first discuss the general protocols
               for the synthesis of G-BFNs, especially diverse facile and
               eco-friendly strategies. Then, we carefully summarize the current
               developed G-BFNs based on their nanostructures and

               stimuli-responsibility, graphene-inorganic nanohybrids,

               electronics/electrical items, manufacturing scrap, discarded
               constructional materials, polymers from daily needs, etc., is
               being generated day-by-day, whereas its treatment is lagging. The
               term zero waste (ZW) is continuously encouraging both producers
               and consumers to adopt sustainable approaches in order to reduce
               their expenditures as well as to help in making a better world.
               In the past, researchers have highlighted numerous techniques to
               tackle physical waste, however the chemicals which are normally
               generated from this waste is more critical and limitedly

               for future of manufacturing by which the burning issue of “Waste”
               can be tackled. However, ZWM can be supported with recycling and

               Already adopted by some companies, it consists of reusing
               industrial scraps to produce innovative manufacturing products.
               Nowadays, in fact, only a small percentage of Lecce Stone (LS)
               scraps is recycled and used as raw material in other fields,

  abstract  = "Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology is actively utilized
               in various industrial fields because it facilitates effective and
               customizable fabrication of complex structures. An important
               processing route for 3D printing is the extrusion of inks in the
               form of colloidal suspensions or emulsions, which has recently
               attracted considerable attention because it allows for selection
               of a wide range of printing materials and is operable under
               ambient processing conditions. Herein, we investigate the 3D
               printability of complex fluids containing chlorella microalgae as
               an eco-friendly material for 3D printing. Two possible ink types
               are considered: aqueous chlorella suspensions and emulsions of
               oil and water mixtures. While the aqueous chlorella suspensions
               at high particle loading display the 3D-printable rheological
               properties such as high yield stress and good shape retention,
               the final structures after extruding and drying the suspensions
               under ambient conditions show a significant number of macroscopic
               defects, limiting their practical application. In contrast, the
               3D structures produced from the oil-in-water Pickering emulsions
               stabilized by chlorella microalgae, which are amphiphilic and
               active at the oil–water interface, show significantly reduced
               defect formation. Addition of a fast-evaporable oil phase,
               hexane, is crucial in the mechanisms of enhanced cementation
               between the individual microalgae via increased inter-particle
               packing, capillary attraction, and hydrophobic interaction.
               Furthermore, addition of solid paraffin wax, which is crystalline
               but well-soluble in the hydrocarbon oil phase under ambient
               conditions, completely eliminates the undesirable defect
               formation via enhanced inter-particle binding, while maintaining
               the overall rheological properties of the emulsion. The optimal
               formulation of the Pickering emulsion is finally employed to
               produce a 3D scaffold of satisfactory structural integrity,
               suggesting that the chlorella-based ink, in the form of an
               emulsion, has potential as an eco-friendly 3D printing ink
               processable under ambient conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",

               illustrate the authors' position, a case from the construction
               sector is presented, for which the feasibility and impact of 3D
               printing technology has been studied. The empirical study focuses
               on the effect of the use of 3D printing technology on the

               in construction, but including suppliers, architects and
               designers as well. Findings - 3D printing of concrete potentially
               provides several improvements in manufacturing performance, such
               as a shortening of lead times, integration of functions and
               allowing for reduced material usage, therefore possibly turning

               consumption, and improve workmanship. The 3D-printed concrete
               technology (3DPCT), more broadly recognized as the design of a 3D
               object via a computer-aided design (CAD) model or a digital 3D
               model, has accelerated considerable progress in these areas in
               other industries. Although 3DPCT has advanced remarkably in
               recent years, producing an appropriate 3D printing material that
               improves performance while reducing material consumption, which
               is really important for CO2 reduction, is urgently needed. The
               present 3DPCT faces many obstacles, one of which is the limited
               range of printable concretes. To tackle this limitation,
               extensive studies on developing creative approaches for
               formulating alkali-activated materials (AAMs) for 3DPCT for
               modern building applications have been conducted. AAMs are
               maintainable substitutive binders to ordinary Portland cement.
               Therefore, the need to undertake a comprehensive literature
               review on the current status of AAM performance on 3D-printable
               concretes for building applications is substantial. This article
               comprehensively reviews the quality requirements, advantages,
               disadvantages, common techniques, delivery, and placement of
               3DCP. This literature also delivers indepth reviews on the
               behaviors and the properties of AAM-based concrete composites
               used in 3D-printed construction. Moreover, research trends are
               moving toward a wide-ranging understanding concerning the
               economic benefits and the environmental footprints of 3DCP for
               building applications with AAMs as suitable concrete materials
               for the emerging robust eco-friendly concrete composite for
               digital construction constructions nowadays. Given the merits of
               the study, several hotspot research topics for future
               investigations are also provided for facilitating the wide use of
               3DPCT in real applications to address rapidly the gap between

  abstract  = "The plastic industry is undergoing drastic changes, due to the
               customer sustainability perception of plastics, and the eruption
               of new processes (such 3D printing) and materials (such as
               renewably sourced resins). To enable a fast transition to
               high-quality, sustainable plastic applications, a specific
               methodology could be a key competitive advantage. This novel
               methodology is focused on improving the objectivity and
               efficiency of plastic production and the design review process.
               It is applicable to discrete optimization events in any product
               lifecycle milestone, from concept design to serial production
               stages. The methodology includes a natural way to capture
               plastic-related knowledge and trends, oriented towards building a
               dynamic “interaction matrix”, with a list of potential
               optimizations and their positive or negative impacts in a
               comprehensive set of multi-criteria evaluations. With an
               innovative approach, the matrix allows the possibility to
               incorporate a business strategy, which could be different at
               every lifecycle stage. The business strategy is translated from
               the common “verbal” definition into a quantitative set of “Target
               and Restrictions”, making it possible to detect and prioritize
               the best potential design optimization changes according to the
               strategy. This methodology helps to model and compare design
               alternatives, verify impacts in every evaluation criteria, and
               make robust and objective information-based decisions. The
               application of the methodology in real cases of plastic material
               design optimization in the automotive industry has provided
               remarkable results, accelerating the detection of improvement
               methods aligned with the strategy and maximizing the improvement
               in product competitiveness and sustainability. In comparison with
               the simultaneous application of existing mono-criteria
               optimization methodologies (such as “Design to Cost” or “Eco
               Design”) and subjective expert-based reviews, the novel
               methodology has a reduced workload and risks, confirming its
               potential for future application and further development in other
               polymer-based products, such as consumer goods or packaging. ©

               and lignin) has attracted increasing attention by using this
               abundant, sustainable, and ecofriendly material. While cellulose
               can be easily tailored into a highly viscous ink for 3D printing,
               after solvent evaporation, the final printed structures become
               highly porous, fragile, and easily fall apart in water due to its
               hydrophilic nature. Lignin, another crucial component of natural
               lignocellulose, has not yet been reported for ink printing due to
               its unfavorable rheological behavior. Herein, a low-cost direct
               ink printing strategy is developed to fabricate lignin-based 3D
               structures with lignin no further refined and a more compact
               microstructure as well as different functionalities compared with
               printed cellulose. By using a soft triblock copolymer as the
               crosslinking agent, the rheology of lignin-based inks can be
               adjusted from soft to rigid, and even enables vertical printing
               which requires stiff and self-supporting features. The
               lignin-based inks contain less water (≈40 wt\%) and exhibit a
               much denser, stiffer structure, resulting in a wet tensile
               strength of ≈30 MPa, compared to only ≈0.6 MPa for printed
               cellulose. In addition, the unique macromolecular structure of

               Results: The estimated total cost of a single mask is
               approximately 5 USD. The virtual design of a complete mask lasted
               68 minutes on average. Most healthcare workers rated comfort as
               very good. Conclusions: Based on the encouraging results
               obtained, we can confidently confirm that custom-made masks are
               novel and useful devices that may be used in the fight against
               COVID-19. © 2021 Journal of Infection in Developing Countries.

               technology with higher resource efficiency and better ecological
               benefits in production systems. However, recent works have shown
               that the ecological benefits of AM are sensitive to the
               parameters in operation. If the parameters are not designed
               appropriately, the ecological performance of AM can be worse than
               conventional manufacturing processes. To ensure the ecological
               benefits of AM, eco-design based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
               is a promising approach to analyze and minimize the environmental
               impacts of AM. However, LCA can only be carried out at the later
               stage of the design process after most design and decision
               operations are already made because the implementation of LCA
               requires detailed process and inventory information of the entire
               life cycle. If users attempt to optimize the ecological
               performance of their design solutions, they need to repeat almost
               the entire design process. To solve this problem, this work
               suggests using energy performance assessment to replace LCA in

               framework consisting of three parts: a simulation tool for energy
               consumption prediction of AM, an assessment model for energy
               performance of AM, and general workflows of eco-design for AM.
               Since the energy performance quantification and assessment of AM
               require less process information, it can be integrated earlier
               and easier into the eco-design for AM. Additionally, an example

               countries and remote communities in developed countries with
               limited resources. Microbial electrochemical cell-based (MXC)
               biosensors have been quite promising for quantitative and
               semi-quantitative (often qualitative) measurements of various
               water quality parameters due to their low cost and simplicity
               compared to traditional analytical methods. However, conventional
               MXC biosensors often encounter challenges, such as the slow
               establishment of biofilms, low sensitivity, and poor
               recoverability, making them unable to be applied for practical
               cases. In response, MXC biosensors assembled with paper-based
               materials demonstrated tremendous potentials to enhance
               sensitivity and field applicability. Furthermore, the paper-based
               platforms offer many prominent features, including autonomous

               novel printing setup employs a low-cost printer to print a
               plastic-based filament and a conductive silver ink paste
               simultaneously. As there were no printers available in the market
               for this application, the open-source fused filament fabrication
               (FFF) printer was modified to accommodate two extruders mounted
               on the same extruder carriage. Techcon TS250 air pressure
               dispenser was employed for the extrusion of silver ink. Extension
               pieces for the extruder carriage were also 3-D printed using a
               fused deposition modeling (FDM) printer to reduce the production
               costs. A bandstop FSS comprising of square loop elements was
               designed to demonstrate the full fabrication. The FSS operated at
               a central frequency of 2.55 GHz and provided a good angle of
               response with wide bandwidths. Surface profiles of the printed

  abstract  = "Lead-free piezoelectric composites with polymeric matrices offer
               a scalable and eco-friendly solution to sensing and energy
               harvesting applications. Piezoelectric polymers such as PVDF are
               particularly interesting because of the possibility to engineer
               the performance of these materials through addition of
               higher-performance piezoelectric inclusions and nanomaterials and
               to scalably manufacture such composites by emerging techniques
               such as 3D printing. This work makes two contributions, namely
               towards composite design and towards development of accurate
               effective property models. In the context of composite design, we
               evaluate the piezoelectric performance of PVDF modified by the
               addition of polycrystalline-BaTiO3 and multiwalled carbon
               nanotubes. Firstly, the addition of BaTiO3 dramatically improves
               the electric field within the composite offering significant
               advantages specially at low BaTiO3 concentrations. Secondly, the
               addition of carbon nanotubes to the matrix, particularly at
               higher BaTiO3 loadings, leads to an order of magnitude increase
               in the piezoelectric flux generation. Further enhancement in the
               flux generation is also possible by tuning the polycrystallinity
               of the BaTiO3 inclusions. However, these behaviours are
               inclusion-driven and the piezoelectric behaviour of the matrix
               does not contribute to this improvement. Importantly, a small
               addition of BaTiO3 and CNT into the PVDF matrix, away from
               percolation, can simultaneously improve flux and electric field
               generation. In this part of the work, we assume an isotropic PVDF
               matrix. Given that PVDF is elastically anisotropic, the second
               aspect of this work is the development of an effective property
               model for CNT-modified PVDF, taking into account the elastic
               anisotropy of poled PVDF, to predict the elastic coefficients of
               CNT-modified PVDF matrices, thus undertaking a key step towards
               modelling anisotropic piezoelectric composites. We show that the
               anisotropy-based model makes similar predictions in the effective
               composite behaviour, indicating that in the case of PVDF-based
               piezocomposites, the anisotropy of the matrix does not
               significantly affect the piezoresponse. © 2019 IOP Publishing

               printing - 3DP) have been rapidly advancing into various
               industrial sectors, including aerospace, automotive, medical,
               architecture, arts and design, food, and construction.
               Transitioning from the visualization and prototyping stages into
               functional and actual part replacement opens further design
               possibilities. Among the diverse applications of AM, construction
               applications have not yet seen a commercially available and
               widely used product in the market. Nevertheless, it has been a
               subject of interest to researchers in recent decades. There are
               evident challenges and risks for the integration of AM towards
               large-scale construction. Therefore, progress in their
               commercialization seems to proceed at a slow pace, as only a few
               3DP trials for large-scale construction can be found in the
               literature. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive and
               evidence-based baseline along with progresses in relevant
               disciplines related to 3DP in construction, which will provide an
               opportunity to experts in all domains to understand the
               multi-dimensional constraints and to specify the future research
               directions in these sectors. The distinct merit of this article
               is that it provides, for the first time, a diverse review on
               literature in the field of construction 3D printing. It offers
               up-to-date and in-depth information of hindrances (from
               processes, materials, structural design and standards) which add
               up towards low pace of automation in construction sector,
               identify deficiencies in the current research and provides future
               research trends for researchers. The findings from intensive
               literature review will guide engineers, designers and investors
               from construction sector to grab research gaps and business
               opportunities. First of all, the development of different 3DP
               processes in built environment are presented to highlight the
               process constraints along with the commercial applications of
               these processes for industrialists and investors to identify the

               have seen extensively used to produce complex-geometry objects.
               However, the relatively restricted range of 3D printable
               biocomposites decelerated its adoption in the biomedical sector
               as a conventional manufacturing technique. In this method, the
               introduction of biofillers with unique properties to produce high
               performance composites as printing feedstocks are increasingly
               recommended. The interest in using eco-friendly fillers from
               waste as reinforcing agents for producing lightweight and
               low-cost poly(lactic acid) (PLA) composites is recently
               increased. In this work, a series of PLA biocomposites filled
               with calcined seashell (CSh) particles have been prepared by melt
               mixing technique using a twin-screw extruder, and characterized
               by different morphological, thermal, and mechanical methods. The
               visco-elastic parameters have been determined for these
               biocomposites to optimize their processing conditions. The
               morphological analysis revealed a homogenous dispersion of CSh
               fillers within the biopolymeric matrix, which was responsible for
               the enhancement of the various mechanical properties. Where, by
               adding 10 wt\% of treated CSh, the tensile modulus and strength
               were significantly increased from 183.8 ± 4.7 MPa and 29.81 ± 1.8
               MPa to 241.9 ± 63 MPa and 49.06 ± 8.87 MPa, respectively,
               compared to the virgin PLA. In addition, respected to PLA matrix,
               the compressive moduli of the printed specimens of PLA/5CSh and
               PLA/10CSh biocomposite filaments exhibited improvements of 5\%
               and 14\%, respectively. Moreover, the thermal analysis showed a
               marked improvement in the thermal stability of the elaborated
               biocomposites, where the degradation temperature (Td50) have been
               upgraded by 4°C for the biocomposite containing 10 wt\% of CSh
               bio-filler. These outstanding properties of PLA/CSh composites

               field of biomedicine. However, the unmatched biomechanics and
               poor bioactivities of conventional Ti implants usually lead to
               insufficient osseointegration. To tackle these challenges, it is
               critical to develop a novel Ti implant that meets the bioadaptive
               requirements for load-bearing critical bone defects. Notably,
               three-dimensional (3D)-printed Ti implants mimic the
               microstructure and mechanical properties of natural bones.
               Additionally, eco-friendly techniques based on inorganic-binding
               peptides have been applied to modify Ti surfaces. Herein, in our
               study, Ti surfaces were modified to reinforce osseointegration
               using chimeric peptides constructed by connecting W9, RP1P, and
               minTBP-1 directly or via (GP)4, respectively. PR1P is derived
               from the extracellular VEGF-binding domain of prominin-1, which
               increases the expression of VEGF and promotes the binding of VEGF
               to endothelial cells, thereby accelerating angiogenesis. W9

               stem cells and human mesenchymal stem cells to promote bone
               formation. Overall, chimeric peptides promote osseointegration by
               promoting angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Additionally, chimeric
               peptides with P3\&4 were more effective than those with P1\&2 in
               improving osseointegration, which might be ascribed to the

               which enable them to be used for numerous applications due to
               their flexibility, light weight, low noise, and many degrees of

               servomotors, introduce design constraints related to their size,

               attributes that preclude the use of robots developed with such

               presents a robust design of a jellyfish-like robot with eight

               biological locomotion and appearance of a jellyfish found in
               nature; the Chrysaora colorata species. Four 127 μm diameter SMA
               wires (of mass 14 mg each) were used per channel to deform the
               silicone bell margin. The robot can operate up to 1608 cycles
               continuously for 1.5 h underwater at high power input (3 times
               higher than the standard) and sustain its own total body mass of
               650 g (∼6000 times the weight of the actuators used). KryptoJelly
               is able to maneuver in both vertical and horizontal directions

               CTE decreases with increasing cenosphere content resulting in
               lower thermal stresses and under diffusion of raster leading to
               non-warped prints. Micrography on freeze fractured filament and
               prints show cenospheres uniform distribution in HDPE. Intact
               cenospheres lower the foam density making it lightweight. Tensile
               tests are carried out on filaments and printed samples while
               flexural properties are investigated for 3D prints. Cenospheres
               addition resulted in improved tensile modulus and decreased
               filament strength. Tensile and flexural modulus of printed foams
               increases with filler content. Results are also compared with
               injection molded samples. Printed foams registered comparable
               tensile strength. Specific tensile modulus is noted to be
               increased with cenospheres loading implying weight saving
               potential of 3D printed foams. Property map reveals printed foams

               Multi-array Average (RMA) procedure, which was primarily designed
               for analysing gene expression data from Affymetrix arrays. Given
               the abundance of Affymetrix microarrays and the popularity of the
               RMA method, it is crucially important that the normalization
               procedure is applied appropriately. In this study we carried out
               simulation experiments and also analysed real microarray data to
               investigate the suitability of RMA when it is applied to dataset
               with different groups of biological samples. From our
               experiments, we showed that RMA with QN does not preserve the
               biological signal included in each group, but rather it would mix
               the signals between the groups. We also showed that the Median
               Polish method in the summarization step of RMA has similar mixing
               effect. RMA is one of the most widely used methods in microarray
               data processing and has been applied to a vast volume of data in
               biomedical research. The problematic behaviour of this method
               suggests that previous studies employing RMA could have been
               misadvised or adversely affected. Therefore we think it is
               crucially important that the research community recognizes the
               issue and starts to address it. The two core elements of the RMA
               method, quantile normalization and Median Polish, both have the
               undesirable effects of mixing biological signals between
               different sample groups, which can be detrimental to drawing
               valid biological conclusions and to any subsequent analyses.
               Based on the evidence presented here and that in the literature,
               we recommend exercising caution when using RMA as a method of
               processing microarray gene expression data, particularly in
               situations where there are likely to be unknown subgroups of

               concept used to reduce accesses to slow local memories. In this
               work, we extend the caching idea to MPI-3 Remote Memory Access

               of MPI-3 RMA, to automatically optimize code with minimum user
               intervention. We demonstrate how cached RMA improves the
               performance of a Barnes Hut simulation and a Local Clustering
               Coefficient computation up to a factor of 1.8x and 5x,
               respectively. Due to the low overheads in the cache miss case and
               the potential benefits, we expect that our ideas around

               a new RMA API that would better meet the needs of both users and
               implementers, and presents a strawman proposal for such an API.

               expression vector of precursor miR-15a (pre-miR-15a) was
               constructed. Paired oligonucleotides for pre-miR-15a expression
               were designed and synthesized chemically. Annealed
               oligonucleotides were inserted into a pGCSIL-GFP vector under a
               U6 promoter to construct a pre-miR-15a expression plasmid.
               Oligonucleotides with a scrambled sequence which were used as a
               negative control were also constructed into the pGCSIL-GFP
               vector. A recombinant expression vector was identified through
               PCR and sequencing. A pre-miR-15a expression plasmid and a
               negative control plasmid were all transferred into Raji cells
               with lipofectamine 2000. Quantitative reverse-transcription
               polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed to explore
               expression of miR-15a. The expression levels of the protein were
               assayed via immunoﬂ uorescence. The growth effect of Raji cells
               was measured by CCK8 assay. Apoptosis was determined using
               Hoechst dyeing and flow cytometry. The growth-inhibitory effect
               on Raji cells was measured using a CCK8 assay.RESULTS The results
               showed that the insertion sequence was correct. The expression
               level of miR-15a was obviously higher in Raji cells transferred
               with pre-miR-15a plasmid than in the blank group and in the
               negative control group. After Raji cells were transferred with
               the pre-miR-15a expression plasmid for 48 h, Bcl-2 protein
               expression levels were obviously decreased，which indicated that
               there was a significant difference as compared with the negative
               control group and blank group (P < 0.05). The CCK8 assay showed
               that transfection of pre-miR-15a expression plasmid decreased the
               cell growth at 24, 48 and 72 h post-transfection. After Raji
               cells were transferred with pre-miR-15a expression plasmid,
               apoptotic cells can be seen with Hoechst dyeing, and the cell
               apoptotic rate was obviously higher than that in blank group and

               apoptosis and inhibit the growth of Raji cells.",

               high-altitude hypoxic environment on circulating
               miR-210-3p.Methods: We examined and compared the levels of
               miR-210-3p using TaqMan-based qRT-PCR in both peripheral blood
               cells and plasma from 84 ethnic Chinese Tibetans residing at 3560

               Chinese residing at 8.9 m (Nanjing Han). Furthermore, we analyzed
               the correlations of miR-210-3p with hematological indices.
               Results: The relative concentrations of miR-210-3p to internal
               reference U6 in blood cells were significantly higher in the
               Tibet Han group (1.01±0.11, P<0.001) and in the Tibetan group
               (1.17±0.09, P<0.001) than in the Nanjing Han group (0.51±0.04).
               The absolute concentrations of plasma miR-210-3p were also
               markedly elevated in the Tibet Han group (503.54±42.95 fmol/L,
               P=0.004) and in the Tibetan group (557.78±39.84 fmol/L, P<0.001)
               compared to the Nanjing Han group (358.39±16.16 fmol/L). However,
               in both blood cells and plasma, miR-210-3p levels were not
               significantly different between the Tibet Han group and the
               Tibetan group (P=0.280, P=0.620, respectively). Plasma miR-210-3p
               concentrations were positively correlated with miR-210-3p levels
               in blood cells (r=0.192, P=0.005). Furthermore, miR-210-3p levels

               response to hypoxic environments and could be associated with

               transferred to operation room using 3D-printed surgical
               templates. Frankfort horizontal plane (FHP), midfacial plane
               (perpendicular to the FHP through the nasion), and coronal plane
               (perpendicular to the FHP through the sella point) were the
               selected three symmetry planes.Midpoint of the contact of the
               maxillary and mandibular central incisors (UI, LI), and the
               mesio-buccal cusp of the first maxillary and mandibular molars
               (U6-R,U6-L, L6-R, L6-L) were the six chosen volumetric landmarks.
               To calculate the linear difference and overall mean linear
               difference (mean difference of the distance between UI, LI, U6-R,
               U6-L, L6-R, L6-L to FHP, midfacial and coronal plane) between
               simulated and postoperative models, the distance between selected
               landmarks and symmetry planes was measured. To calculate the
               angular difference and overall mean angular difference, values of
               the angles constructed by the occlusal, palatal, and mandibular
               plane to FHP and midfacial plane respectively were determined on
               simulated and postoperative models.Results The virtual surgical
               planning was successfully transferred to actual surgery with the
               help of 3D-printed surgical templates. All patients were
               satisfied with the postoperative facial profile and occlusion.
               The overall mean linear difference was 0.81 mm (0.71 mm for
               maxilla and 0.91 mm for mandible); and the overall mean angular
               difference was 0.95° (the mean angular difference relative to FHP
               was 1.10°, and that relative to midfacial plane was
               0.83°).Conclusion Virtual surgical planning facilitated the
               diagnosis, treatment planning, and precise bony segments

               geneexpression and the influence on the malignant proliferation
               of A2 cells after quenching COX-2 in vitro . Methods Three COX-2
               siRNA expression vectors with human U6 promoter were constructed.
               The COX-2 siRNA vectors and the vacant vector (pEGFP) were
               transfected into A2 cells with lipofectamine respectively. The
               cell strains transfected were selected. The change of COX-2

               contrast to A2 cells, COX-2 mRNA levels of A2-3, A2-7 and A2-10
               cells were reduced 15.6\%, 20.4\% and 64.2\% respectively, and
               COX-2 protein expressions of them were reduced 23.7\%, 36.7\% and

               changes in frequency of subgingival microflora that occur after
               placement and removal of fixed orthodontic appliance using
               polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Methods. This study included 33
               orthodontic patients, who were divided into two groups.
               Subgingival plaque samples were collected from the right upper
               incisor (U1) and right upper first molar (U6). In group A, the
               samples were taken three times: before placement appliance (T1),
               after one month (T2), and after 3 months (T3). In group B the
               samples were also taken three times: before appliance removal
               (T1), after one month (T2), and after three months (T3). PCR
               method was used to determine the presence of P. gingivalis, A.
               actinomycetemcomitans, T. forsythia, and P. intermedia. Results.
               In group A the frequency of P. gingivalis showed statistically
               significant decrease at U1 (p=0.049) and U6 (p=0.008), from T1 to
               T2, and at U1 (p=0.048) from T1 to T3. In group B only the
               frequency of T. forsythia showed a statistically significant
               decrease, at U6 (T1 vs. T2, p=0.004; T1 vs. T3, p=0.0003).
               Regarding other analyzed bacteria, changes in the presence were
               noticed but no statistical significance was found. Conclusion.
               Placement of fixed appliances may have an impact on subgingival
               microflora, but in the first months after the placement and
               removal of the appliance changes were not significant, probably
               due to good oral hygiene. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike

              factors and enzymes. Each snRNP contains a ring-shaped subcomplex
              of seven proteins and a specific RNA molecule. The U6 snRNP
              contains a unique heptameric Lsm protein complex, which
              specifically recognizes the U6 small nuclear RNA at its 3' end.
              Here we report the crystal structures of the heptameric Lsm
              complex, both by itself and in complex with a 3' fragment of U6
              snRNA, at 2.8 Å resolution. Each of the seven Lsm proteins
              interacts with two neighbouring Lsm components to form a
              doughnut-shaped assembly, with the order Lsm3-2-8-4-7-5-6. The

  abstract = "U6 snRNA is one of five uridine-rich noncoding RNAs that form the
              major spliceosome complex. Unlike other U-snRNAs, it reveals many
              distinctive aspects of biogenesis such as transcription by RNA
              polymerase III, transcript nuclear retention and particular
              features of transcript ends: monomethylated 5'-guanosine
              triphosphate as cap structure and a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate moiety
              (>P) at the 3' termini. U6-snRNA plays a central role in splicing
              and thus its transcription, maturation, snRNP formation, and
              recycling are essential for cellular homeostasis. U6 snRNA enters
              the splicing cycle as part of the tri-U4/U6.U5snRNP complex, and
              after significant structural arrangements forms the catalytic site
              of the spliceosome together with U2 snRNA and Prp8. U6 snRNA also
              contributes to the splicing reaction by coordinating metal cations
              required for catalysis. Many human diseases are associated with
              altered splicing processes. Disruptions of the basal splicing
              machinery can be lethal or lead to severe diseases such as spinal
              muscular atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or retinitis
              pigmentosa. Recent studies have identified a new U6 snRNA
              biogenesis factor Usb1, the absence of which leads to poikiloderma
              with neutropenia (PN) (OMIM 604173), an autosomal recessive skin
              disease. Usb1 is an evolutionarily conserved 3'→5' exoribonuclease
              that is responsible for removing 3'-terminal uridines from U6
              snRNA transcripts, which leads to the formation of a 2',3' cyclic
              phosphate moiety (>P). This maturation step is fundamental for U6
              snRNP assembly and recycling. Usb1 represents the first example of
              a direct association between a spliceosomal U6 snRNA biogenesis

  abstract = "RNA polymerase type III (Pol-III) promoters such as U6 are
              commonly used to express small RNAs, including short hairpin RNAs
              (shRNAs) and single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Functional U6 promoters
              are widely used in CRISPR systems, and their characterization can
              facilitate genome editing of non-model organisms. In the present
              study, six U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) promoters containing two
              conserved elements of a proximal sequence element (PSEA) and a
              TATA box, were identified and characterized in the diamondback
              moth (Plutella xylostella) genome. Relative efficiency of the U6
              promoters to express shRNA induced EGFP knockdown was tested in a
              P. xylostella cell line, revealing that the PxU6:3 promoter had
              the strongest expression effect. Further work with the PxU6:3
              promoter showed its efficacy in EGFP knockout using CRISPR/Cas9
              system in the cells. The expression plasmids with versatile
              Pxabd-A gene specific sgRNA driven by the PxU6:3 promoter,
              combined with Cas9 mRNA, could induce mutagenesis at specific
              genomic loci in vivo. The phenotypes induced by sgRNA expression
              plasmids were similar to those done in vitro transcription sgRNAs.
              A plasmid with two tandem arranged PxU6:3:sgRNA expression
              cassettes targeting Pxabd-A loci was generated, which caused a
              28,856 bp fragment deletion, suggesting that the multi-sgRNA
              expression plasmid can be used for multi-targeting. Our work
              indicates that U6 snRNA promoters can be used for functional
              studies of genes with the approach of reverse genetics in P.

              potential for CRISPR-derived gene drive as a tactic for population
              control in this globally significant pest.",

  abstract = "Brr2 is a DExD/H-box RNA helicase that is responsible for U4/U6
              unwinding, a critical step in spliceosomal activation. Brr2 is a
              large protein (∼250 kD) that consists of an N-terminal domain
              (∼500 residues) with unknown function and two Hel308-like modules
              that are responsible for RNA unwinding. Here we demonstrate that
              removal of the entire N-terminal domain is lethal to Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae and deletion of the N-terminal 120 residues leads to
              splicing defects and severely impaired growth. This N-terminal
              truncation does not significantly affect Brr2's helicase activity.
              Brr2-Δ120 can be successfully assembled into the tri-snRNP (albeit
              at a lower level than the WT Brr2) and the spliceosomal B complex.
              However, the truncation significantly impairs spliceosomal
              activation, leading to a dramatic reduction of U5, U6 snRNAs and
              accumulation of U1 snRNA in the B(act) complex. The N-terminal
              domain of Brr2 does not seem to be directly involved in regulating
              U1/5'ss unwinding. Instead, the N-terminal domain seems to be
              critical for retaining U5 and U6 snRNPs during/after spliceosomal
              activation through its interaction with snRNAs and possibly other
              spliceosomal proteins, revealing a new role of Brr2 in
              spliceosomal activation in addition to U4/U6 unwinding.",

              spliceosome remodeling to allow activation for the two steps of
              intron removal. Spliceosome remodeling is carried out through the
              action of DExD/H-box ATPases that modulate RNA-RNA and protein-RNA
              interactions. The ATPase Prp16 remodels the spliceosome between
              the first and second steps of splicing by catalyzing release of
              first step factors Yju2 and Cwc25 as well as destabilizing U2-U6
              snRNA helix I. How Prp16 destabilizes U2-U6 helix I is not clear.
              We show that the NineTeen Complex (NTC) protein Cwc2 displays
              genetic interactions with the U6 ACAGAGA, the U6 internal stem
              loop (ISL) and the U2-U6 helix I, all RNA elements that form the
              spliceosome active site. We find that one function of Cwc2 is to
              stabilize U2-U6 snRNA helix I during splicing. Cwc2 also
              functionally cooperates with the NTC protein Isy1/NTC30. Mutation
              in Cwc2 can suppress the cold sensitive phenotype of the prp16-302
              mutation indicating a functional link between Cwc2 and Prp16.
              Specifically the prp16-302 mutation in Prp16 stabilizes Cwc2
              interactions with U6 snRNA and destabilizes Cwc2 interactions with
              pre-mRNA, indicating antagonistic functions of Cwc2 and Prp16. We
              propose that Cwc2 is a target for Prp16-mediated spliceosome
              remodeling during pre-mRNA splicing.",

              formation. To determine the contribution towards splicing of
              specific RNA secondary and tertiary interactions in the U2/U6 RNA
              core, we introduced mutations in critical U6 nucleotides and
              tested their effect on splicing using a yeast in vitro U6
              depletion/complementation system. Elimination of selected RNA
              tertiary interactions involving the U6 catalytic triad, or
              deletions of the bases of U6-U80 or U6-A59, had moderate to no
              effect on splicing, showing that the affected secondary and
              tertiary interactions are not required for splicing catalysis.
              However, removal of the base of U6-G60 of the catalytic triad
              completely blocked splicing, without affecting assembly of the
              activated spliceosome or its subsequent conversion into a B*-like

              implicated in catalyzing the splicing of pre-mRNA, but assembly
              and rearrangement steps prior to catalysis require numerous
              proteins. Previous studies have shown that the protein-free U2-U6
              snRNA complex adopts two conformations in equilibrium,
              characterized by four and three helices surrounding a central
              junction. The four-helix conformer is strongly favored in the in
              vitro protein-free state, but the three-helix conformer
              predominates in spliceosomes. To analyze the role of the central
              junction in positioning elements forming the active site, we
              derived three-dimensional models of the two conformations from
              distances measured between fluorophores at selected locations in
              constructs representing the protein-free human U2-U6 snRNA complex
              by time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Data
              describing four angles in the four-helix conformer suggest
              tetrahedral geometry; addition of Mg results in shortening of the
              distances between neighboring helices, indicating compaction of
              the complex around the junction. In contrast, the three-helix
              conformer shows a closer approach between helices bearing critical
              elements, but the addition of Mg widens the distance between them;
              thus in neither conformer are the critical helices positioned to
              favor the proposed triplex interaction. The presence of Mg also
              enhances the fraction of the three-helix conformer, as does
              incubation with the Prp19-related protein RBM22, which has been
              implicated in the remodeling of the U2-U6 snRNA complex to render
              it catalytically active. These data suggest that although the
              central junction assumes a significant role in orienting helices,
              spliceosomal proteins and Mg facilitate formation of the
              catalytically active conformer.",

              snRNA is catalyzed by METTL16, and is important for the 5'-splice
              site recognition by U6 snRNA during pre-mRNA splicing. Human
              METTL16 consists of the N-terminal methyltransferase domain (MTD)
              and the C-terminal vertebrate conserved region (VCR). While the
              MTD has an intrinsic property to recognize a specific sequence in
              the distinct structural context of RNA, the VCR functions have
              remained uncharacterized. Here, we present structural and
              functional analyses of the human METTL16 VCR. The VCR increases
              the affinity of METTL16 toward U6 snRNA, and the conserved basic
              region in VCR is important for the METTL16-U6 snRNA interaction.
              The VCR structure is topologically homologous to the C-terminal
              RNA binding domain, KA1, in U6 snRNA-specific terminal uridylyl
              transferase 1 (TUT1). A chimera of the N-terminal MTD of METTL16
              and the C-terminal KA1 of TUT1 methylated U6 snRNA more
              efficiently than the MTD, indicating the functional conservation
              of the VCR and KA1 for U6 snRNA biogenesis. The VCR interacts with
              the internal stem-loop (ISL) within U6 snRNA, and this interaction
              would induce the conformational rearrangement of the
              A43-containing region of U6 snRNA, thereby modifying the RNA
              structure to become suitable for productive catalysis by the MTD.
              Therefore, the MTD and VCR in METTL16 cooperatively facilitate the
              m6A43 U6 snRNA modification.",

              The role of these modifications in pre-mRNA splicing as well as
              their physiological function in mammals have remained largely
              unclear. Here we report that the La-related protein LARP7
              functions as a critical cofactor for 2'-O-methylation of U6 in
              mouse male germ cells. Mechanistically, LARP7 promotes U6 loading
              onto box C/D snoRNP, facilitating U6 2'-O-methylation by box C/D
              snoRNP. Importantly, ablation of LARP7 in the male germline causes
              defective U6 2'-O-methylation, massive alterations in pre-mRNA

              and solid-state physics, addresses properties of atom-like
              emitters in cavities and can be divided into a weak and a strong
              coupling regime. For weak coupling, the spontaneous emission can
              be enhanced or reduced compared with its vacuum level by tuning
              discrete cavity modes in and out of resonance with the emitter.
              However, the most striking change of emission properties occurs
              when the conditions for strong coupling are fulfilled. In this
              case there is a change from the usual irreversible spontaneous
              emission to a reversible exchange of energy between the emitter
              and the cavity mode. This coherent coupling may provide a basis
              for future applications in quantum information processing or
              schemes for coherent control. Until now, strong coupling of
              individual two-level systems has been observed only for atoms in

              of a single two-level solid-state system with a photon, as
              realized by a single quantum dot in a semiconductor microcavity.
              The strong coupling is manifest in photoluminescence data that

              investigations, in which traditional fluorescent labels based on
              organic molecules fall short of providing long-term stability and
              simultaneous detection of multiple signals. The ability to make
              QDs water soluble and target them to specific biomolecules has led
              to promising applications in cellular labelling, deep-tissue
              imaging, assay labelling and as efficient fluorescence resonance
              energy transfer donors. Despite recent progress, much work still
              needs to be done to achieve reproducible and robust surface
              functionalization and develop flexible bioconjugation techniques.
              In this review, we look at current methods for preparing QD
              bioconjugates as well as presenting an overview of applications.
              The potential of QDs in biology has just begun to be realized and
              new avenues will arise as our ability to manipulate these
              materials improves.",

               multistatic array topology is transformed to a monostatic array,
               and the round-trip propagation is converted into unidirectional
               optical field propagation. The efficiency of the proposed
               algorithm is analyzed theoretically, and demonstrated

              and it was highly lytic against Proteus mirabilis, which causes
              urinary tract infections in humans. In this paper, we characterize
              the biology and complete genome sequence of the phage. Methods and
              Results: Transmission electron microscopy revealed phage pPM\_01
              to be a siphovirus (the first reported virus to infect P.
              mirabilis), with its complete genome sequence successfully
              determined. The genome was sequenced using Illumina technology and
              the reads obtained were assembled using CLC Genomic Workbench v.
              7.0.3. The whole genome contains a total of 58,546 bp of linear
              double-stranded DNA with a G+ C content of 46.9\%. Seventy
              putative genes were identified and annotated using various
              bioinformatics tools including RAST, Geneious v. R7, National
              Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLAST, and
              tRNAscan-SE-v1.3 Search. Functional clusters of related potential
              genes were defined (structural, lytic, packaging, replication,
              modification, and modulatory). The whole genome sequence showed a
              low similarity to known phages (i.e., Enterobacter phage Enc34 and
              Enterobacteria phage Chi). Host range determination and SDS-PAGE
              analysis were also performed. Conclusions: The inability to
              lysogenize a host, the absence of endotoxin genes in the annotated
              genome, and the lytic behavior suggest phage pPM\_01 as a possible
              safe biological candidate to control P. mirabilis infection. (C)

              the fabrication of such sensors at low cost is always challenging.
              High sensitivity is an important parameter for trace level (ppm)
              humidity sensors. Anelectronic detection circuit for interfacing
              the humidity sensor with high sensitivity requires a simple
              hardware circuit with few active devices. The recent trends for
              increasing the sensitivity include fabricating nanoporous film
              with a very large surface area. In the present work, the
              sensitivity of a parallel plate capacitive type sensor with metal
              oxide sensing film has been significantly improved with an aim to
              detect moisture from 3 to 100 ppm in the industrial process gases
              used to fabricate semiconductors and other sensitive electronic
              devices. The sensitivity has been increased by (i) fabricating a
              nanoporous film of aluminum oxide using the sol-gel method and
              (ii) increasing the cross-sectional area of a parallel plate
              capacitor. A novel double sided capacitive structure has been
              proposed where two capacitors have been fabricated-one on the top
              and one on the bottom side of a flat alumina substrat-eand then
              the capacitors are connected in parallel. The structure has twice
              the sensitivity of a single sensor in the same ppm range but the
              size of the structure remains unchanged. The important
              characteristics of the sensors such as the sensitivity (S = Delta
              C/Delta ppm x 100), the response time (t(r)), and the recovery
              time (t(c)) are determined and compared with a commercial SHAW,
              UKdew point meter. The fabricated double sided sensor has
              comparable sensitivity (S = 100\%, t(r) (s) = 28, t(c) (s) = 40)
              with the commercial meter (S = 100.5\%, t(r) (s) = 258) but has a
              faster response time. The proposed method of sensitivity
              enhancement is simple, and mass producible.",

              double-transduction principle for silicon nanowire resonators,
              which exploits the depletion charge modulation in a junctionless
              field effect transistor body and the piezoresistive modulation. A
              mechanical resonance at the very high frequency of 100 MHz is
              detected in the drain current of the highly doped silicon wire
              with a cross-section down to ~ 30 nm. We show that the depletion
              charge modulation provides a ~ 35 dB increase in output
              signal-to-noise compared to the second-order piezoresistive
              detection, which can be separately investigated within the same

              tropospheric) sensing and then applied in nowcasting and
              forecasting research. The tomographic approach can be used to
              determine the distribution of water vapor (WV), the most active
              component of the atmosphere. WV is one of the most important
              drivers of convection and precipitation. In this method, numerous
              line-of-sight integral observations at different locations and
              directions are used to derive a 3-D distribution of a WV
              structure. One of the challenges in GNSS tomography is that
              different parameterization methods are used for computing the
              design matrix. Here, the effect of the straight-line method versus
              the ray-tracing method is investigated for computing the length of
              a ray which passes through the model element. In addition, the

              model is analyzed. The accuracy of the developed model is verified
              using radiosonde measurements in the COST benchmark dataset.
              Results show that the Eikonal ray-tracing method is superior to
              other schemes whether used with topography or not. The mean values

              high moisture content to the synthetic ester which is subjected to

              spectroscopy (EDS), and X-Ray diffraction (XRD) to investigate
              their morphological structures, elemental composition, and crystal
              phase, respectively. Those characterizations were also confirming
              the growth of ZnO nanorods on the already-deposited graphene layer
              on fabrics. From the gas sensor measurements at room temperature,
              it was revealed that these graphene/ZnO nanocomposites were highly
              sensitive and selective towards CO gas at low concentration down
              to 10 ppm. The shortest response and recovery times of the sensors
              were measured to be 280 s and 45 s, respectively. Moreover, in
              comparison to bare graphene sensors, the surface modification by
              ZnO nanorods could obviously enhance the sensing response by up to
              40\% (i.e., doubled sensitivity). These flexible hybrid sensors
              are therefore expected to be a promising alternative for the
              existing rigid CO sensors in the market by offering unique
              nanostructures, low-cost fabrication, high flexibility, and good

              minimization of production line disruptions due to the performance
              of suppliers, minimization of the complaints of production line

              uses precomputed look-up tables (LUTs) to enable fast and accurate
              evaluation of circuit sizing scenarios without a simulator in the

              decision making and architectural innovation that is difficult to
              attain with fully automated, black-box sizing tools. Our
              discussion begins with an overview of the LUT-based design
              paradigm and its two primary variants: inverse design (finding
              design parameters that meet the specifications) and forward

              non-return-to-zero (NRZ) optical link’s quarter-rate receivers is
              presented, that utilizes proxy timing recovery for fast turn-on
              time. The proxy timing recovery scheme takes advantage of
              correlated data jitter over parallel optical lanes typically
              deployed in a data-center. Rapid timing recovery of the burst-mode
              channel is enabled by incrementing/decrementing its phase rotator
              (PR) control code during idle periods using phase updates from an
              always-active channel in the link. This work also presents
              circuit-design techniques to reduce power dissipation during idle
              times while still enabling fast turn-on time. Simulated in 65 nm
              CMOS technology, the proposed CDR consumes only 19.5 mW per
              channel while operating at 10 Gbps/ch and 0.58 mW during its
              idle-state. Simulation results are presented for the turn-on time
              with the proposed technique and compared against the turn-on time
              of a conventional receiver. The proposed technique allows the CDR
              to lock within 26 unit intervals (UIs) from when it is powered on
              irrespective of a 1000 ppm frequency offset between the incoming
              data and the CDR’s reference clock. The complete CDR of each
              channel occupies an area of 0.045 mm2. The proposed scheme

  abstract = "Energy-efficient timer circuits are required in numerous
              applications for periodic operations, such as performing
              measurements and communicating data. In this paper, we present a
              gate-leakage-based timer that utilizes an amplifier-less
              replica-bias switching technique to generate a stable frequency,
              which can operate at a low supply voltage. To guarantee a stable
              oscillation frequency in a small circuit area, the proposed design
              adopts an architecture that discharges a pre-charged capacitor
              through a resistive element (gate-leaking MOS capacitor) with a
              low-leakage switch. In the proposed switching technique, the
              low-voltage timer operates by tracking the discharging terminal of
              the capacitor and biasing the reference voltage of the switch
              unit, thereby enabling the minimization of the leakage current
              without the need for analog amplifier circuits. The high supply
              sensitivity of the timer is addressed by regulating the supply
              voltage using a native NMOS header (NNH). The proposed design is
              fabricated using the 55-nm deeply depleted channel (DDC) CMOS
              technology, which has a strong body coefficient and occupies an
              active circuit area of 0.0022 mm2. The measurements show that the
              proposed design can achieve an energy-per-cycle value of 25
              pJ/cycle at a supply voltage of 350 mV when body biasing is
              applied. The measured Allan deviation floor is 200 ppm at room

              systems are much lighter and more compact than standard permanent
              or superconductive magnets. However, improved designs and
              manufacturing techniques aiming at lower weight and smaller
              external size are an area of continual interest especially for
              application to space flight. Most Halbach magnet design techniques
              aim to optimize homogeneity suitable for MRI over a
              diameter-spherical volume (DSV) that requires the aspect ratio
              (length/inner diameter) to be larger than 1.5:1. Furthermore,
              current magnet construction techniques often use low-coercivity
              magnetic pieces and imperfect formers that produce a mismatch in
              the intended designs. As a result, Halbach magnets require complex
              shimming methods to improve the magnetic field homogeneity,
              causing further size and weight increase. Here, we propose to
              reduce the weight and the aspect ratio of the Halbach magnet by
              optimizing homogeneity over a cylindrical region of interest (ROI)
              rather than a DSV, applying a genetic algorithm, high-coercivity
              ferromagnets (N40UH) and a robust construction technique. The
              assembled 67 mT magnet, with aspect ratio ~ 1:1, produces almost

              occurs early in ischemic stroke. However, detection of mild
              acidosis is still challenging. To enhance CEST detection for
              ischemia, we proposed a quantification approach using the residual
              of inversed Z-spectra, i.e. MTRRexVOPVP = 1/Zexp-1/Zref , where
              the reference Z-spectra Zref was calculated using our previously
              developed Voxel-wise Optimization of Pseudo Voigt Profile (VOPVP).
              Simulations were performed at two different exchange rates of
              amide, representing different pH values. Among all tested
              quantification methods, including MTRasym, Lorentzian Difference
              (LD), VOPVP residual (ZVOPVP residual), the analytical solution
              and MTRRexOPVP, MTRRexVOPVP exhibited the largest difference
              between the two exchange rates. In vivo CEST-MRI was performed at
              7 Tesla in rat brain, at 2 hours after transient ischemia by
              middle cerebral artery occlusion. Firstly, Z-spectra images were
              assessed at multiple offsets using histogram analysis, with 3.5
              and -3.5 ppm exhibiting significant changes between normal rats
              and stroke rats (n = 5 each). For all stroke rats, MTRRexVOPVP
              images (3.5 ppm) exhibited a large area of hypointensity in the
              lesion hemisphere. In contrast, MTRasym and the three-offsets
              method failed in detecting such changes, particularly for rats
              with little changes on T2w and DWI images. Among all tested
              methods, MTRRexVOPVP achieved the highest contrast-to-noise ratio
              between lesion striatum and the contralateral. For amide, amine
              and NOE, ZresidualVOPVP and MTRRexVOPVP showed significant reduced
              signals in lesions compared to the contralateral, indicating lower
              pH with slower exchange. But Z-spectra and MTRasym signal did not
              show such difference. At later time points (6 hrs and 24 hrs), all
              methods displayed contrast between two hemispheres and MTRRexVOPVP
              still show the largest contrast between the two hemisphere.
              Histology confirmed the edema and other damage in the ipsilateral

              satellite, which is equipped with a CO2-integrated path
              differential absorption (IPDA) LIDAR, in the coming years. The
              space-borne IPDA LIDAR is believed to supplement current passive
              remote sensing techniques in terms of effective observations at
              nights, as well as in high-latitude regions and heavily polluted
              areas. Currently, no LIDAR-based satellite is operational for CO2
              detection in orbit despite the fact that Active Sensing of CO2
              Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS) and Advanced
              Space Carbon and Climate Observation of Planet Earth (A-SCOPE) are
              dedicated to fill this gap. However, the ESA mission proposal
              A-SCOPE dedicated for CO2 measurement was not selected, and
              ASCENDS from NASA remains in the loop but on low priority.
              Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the feasibility
              and effectiveness of this novel technique and to identify
              potential differences among its CO2 concentration products and the
              passive remote sensing technique. In this article, we developed an
              initial data-processing procedure for an airborne CO2-IPDA LIDAR,
              which is the minified prototype of the forthcoming space-borne
              LIDAR. We tested the effectiveness of this procedure and evaluated
              the performance of the minified prototype in a flight test over
              ocean, urban, and mountainous terrain. The column-weighted xCO2
              (XCO2) retrievals obtained by the airborne IPDA LIDAR were
              considerably more sensitive to the gradients of the dry-air mixing
              ratio of CO2 (xCO2) than the XCO2 products of OCO-2 and in situ
              measurements of point xCO2. The mean XCO2 values over the ocean,
              urban, and mountainous area were 411.07, 425.71, and 417.87 ppm
              with STDs of 1.93, 0.85, and 0.96 ppm, respectively. We used
              altitude-dependent xCO2 obtained by a decline-climb flight to
              calculate a reference for XCO2 over the ocean. The difference
              between XCO2 obtained using two means was less than 0.5 ppm.
              Moreover, the actual random error coincided well with the
              simulated random error, suggesting that our previous
              performance-evaluation model was reliable. This model predicted
              that a relative random error of less than 0.3\% would be very
              likely for the forthcoming satellite mission over land. However,
              measuring CO2 concentrations precisely over oceans was identified
              as a very challenging work. Improvements in hardware technology
              are unlikely to narrow this gap largely. Thus, developing
              dedicated algorithms to address CO2 measurement over oceans by
              using IPDA LIDAR is necessary.",

              column-averaged carbon dioxide dry air mole fractions (Xco2) from
              space, provides new data sources to improve our understanding of
              carbon cycle. The available GOSAT data, however, have many gaps
              and are irregularly positioned, which make it difficult to
              directly interpret their scientific significance without further
              data analysis. Spatio-temporal geostatistical prediction approach
              can be used to fill the gaps for global and regional Xco2 mapping.
              It is important to choose a suitable spatio-temporal variogram
              model since modeling spatio-temporal correlation structure using
              variogram model is a critical step in the geostatistical
              prediction. In this study, three different flexible
              spatio-temporal variogram models, including the product-sum model,
              Cressie-Huang model, and Gneiting model, are used to model the
              spatio-temporal correlation structure of Xco2 over China, using
              the Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space retrievals of the
              GOSAT (ACOS-GOSAT) Xco2 (v3.3) data products. The three models are
              compared and evaluated using the weighted mean square errors
              (WMSE) indicating the fitness between the empirical variogram
              surface and the theoretical variogram model, cross-validation for
              quantifying prediction accuracies, and the performance of the
              three models when used to fill the spatial gaps and generate Xco2
              maps in 3-day temporal interval. The results indicate that 1) the
              model fitness of the commonly used product-sum model is slightly
              better than Cressie-Huang model and Gneiting model as indicated
              from WMSE, and 2) all the three models present similar summary
              statistics in cross-validation, all with a significantly high
              correlation coefficient of 0.92, and about 83\% of prediction
              error within 2 ppm and about 53\% within 1 ppm, and (3)
              differences between the mapping results using the three models are
              generally less than 0.1 ppm, and no significant differences can be
              identified. As a conclusion from the above results, all the three
              variogram models can precisely catch the empirical characteristics
              of the spatio-temporal correlation structure of Xco2 over China,
              and the precision and effectiveness of predicting and mapping Xco2
              using the three models are almost the same.",

              (MCP) behavior in an atmospheric homogeneous dielectric barrier
              discharge (HDBD) in helium with air impurities. From the
              simulation results, we find that the O2 Penning ionization plays a
              leading role in the discharge characteristics. As the air content
              increases from 0 ppm to 5000 ppm, the current waveforms show a
              transition from a single-pulse mode to MCP mode, and the number of
              current pulses (Np) also increases. Through analysis, we find that
              although Np increases monotonically, the evolution mechanism of
              the MCP discharges under different ranges of air content is
              different. At lower air concentration (less than 500 ppm here), we
              find the similar explanation as that reported in our previous work
              on the MCP behavior only considering N2 impurity. However, when
              the air content is higher, we find that the seed electron density
              (ne0) remains basically unchanged, not like the sharp drop at
              lower air concentration. Further analysis reveals that the rapid
              growth of direct ionization during a small period before the
              breakdown helps generate MCP discharges. In addition, the
              attachment reaction of O2 is analyzed. Results show that at higher
              air content (above 5000 ppm here), the O2 attachment reaction will
              provide more possibilities of successive ignitions after the first
              pulse with the assistance of the applied voltage, implying a
              stimulative effect of the oxygen on MCP discharges.",

              to detect the presence of sulfate ions in the water samples.
              Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to detect the
              resistive and reactive changes with respect to the corresponding
              changes in the concentration of the tested solutions. Experiments

              peak at 339 nm and a neighboring region of negligible absorption
              at 336 nm as a reference. Using a modulated UV LED as a light

              spectral bands, a simple detection system was constructed
              specifically targeted at formaldehyde. By paying particular

              peaks of the two dyes in the wavelength domain and hence can be

              methods drastically increases the amount of both unigrams and
              bigrams. A previous procedure of flipping onsets has been proven
              to enhance the standard bigram-syllabification by relatively
              decreasing the syllable error rate (SER) by up to 18.02\%.
              Meanwhile, the previous swapping consonant-graphemes has been
              proven to give a relative decrement of SER up to 31.39\%. In this

              concentrations in the melt can be inferred from analyses of glass
              inclusions, which however may not be present in the investigated
              rocks or may have experienced post-entrapment processes that
              modify their volatile records. Apatite is becoming an alternative
              robust tool for unraveling the information of magmatic volatiles.
              Here we report a comprehensive dataset for the concentrations of
              volatiles and major elements in apatite crystals in the rocks from
              two eruptions with contrasting eruptive styles: the 2006
              (dome-forming) and 2010 (explosive) eruptive events at Merapi
              volcano (Java, Indonesia). We obtained two-dimensional
              compositional distributions and in situ concentrations of H2O,
              CO2, F, Cl and S in 50 apatite crystals occurring at various
              textural positions. The CO2 concentrations we report are probably
              the first ones from natural volcanic apatite. Using the volatile
              concentrations in apatite and existing thermodynamic models and
              geothermobarometers, we have calculated the volatile abundances of
              the pre-eruptive melts of the two eruptions. We find that the
              apatite from the 2006 and 2010 deposits have a similar
              compositional range of volatiles, with a bimodal distribution of
              F–H2O–CO2 contents. The apatite included in amphibole has higher
              H2O (0·9–1·0 wt \%) and CO2 (≥2400 ppm), but lower F (0·9–1·4 wt
              \%), compared to crystals included in plagioclase, clinopyroxene,
              or in the groundmass (H2O: 0·4–0·7 wt \%; CO2: 40–900 ppm; F:
              1·7–2·3 wt \%). Using these volatile concentrations and
              apatite-melt exchange coefficients we obtained two distinct ranges
              of H2O–CO2–S–F–Cl concentrations in the melt. Melts in equilibrium
              with apatite included in amphibole had 3–8 wt \% H2O, ≥8000 ppm
              CO2, 340–2000 ppm S, whereas melts in equilibrium with apatite
              included in anhydrous minerals and in the groundmass had lower H2O
              (1·5–4 wt \%), CO2 (60–2500 ppm), and S (10–130 ppm). We
              calculated the melt H2O–CO2 saturation pressures and found that
              they correspond to two main magma storage depths. The shallow
              reservoir with melts stored at ≤10 km below the crater agrees with
              the depths constrained by melt inclusions, as well as the
              geodetic, geophysical and seismic tomography studies from the
              literature. We have also found a significantly deeper melt storage
              zone at ≥25–30 km recorded by the C- and H2O-rich apatite in
              amphibole and barometry calculations using amphibole and high-Al
              clinopyroxene, which matches with the depths reported in seismic
              tomography studies. The high CO2/H2O and CO2/SO2 concentrations of
              the deep melt can help to explain the sharp increase in these
              ratios in fumarolic gas that were sampled just before the eruption
              in 2010. Supply of deep volatiles to the shallower magma column
              before the eruption in 2010 could have increased the magma
              buoyancy, and thus led to higher magma ascent rates and associated
              eruption explosivity. Evidence for the faster pre-eruptive magma
              ascent in 2010 than 2006 is also found on the diffusion distance
              of Cl in apatite microlites.",

              process to solve the challenge of the accuracy of local

              uniform photon distribution at each iteration by eliminating a
              certain number of photons. The tree is also improved to adapt to
              the complicated photon distributions. This strategy also
              facilitates the parallel elimination with a priori elimination

              because of the complex geophysical properties. With good
              performance and moderate cost, geophysical logging is considered
              to be of great potential as the compromise solution between
              seismic and core. Since the “sweet-spot” depending on the sands'
              properties are implied not in the logging “point” but “segment”,
              1D-CNN is supposed to be a better fit for reservoir
              classification: It doesn't pay too much attention to the logging
              signal sequence itself like LSTM, but focuses on feature
              extraction from the whole signals combination. Moreover, samples
              would have various sizes because of different layer thickness.
              While 1D-CNN requires all samples must be converted to a uniform
              size before input. 1D fully convolutional network (1D-FCN) can
              receive any size input of layer thickness without manually
              aligning it to the same size. For the first time in this paper,
              structures of the five networks including two fully connected
              networks (global mapping artificial neural network, GM-ANN and

              convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) are compared and evaluated

              1D-FCN-DAF have achieved the higher area under the curve (AUC)
              with the values of 0.8889 and 0.9107 respectively in average

              topology relationship among components is very complicated.
              Therefore, designing a new PPM is quite time consuming. In order

              extensively used to detect various types of defect by monitoring
              reflected and transmitted signals because they enable faster
              screening of large areas. However, ultrasonic guided wave testing
              becomes difficult for very shallow, sharp defects as current
              inspection techniques suffer from a lack of sensitivity to such
              features. Previous studies, obtained by comparing various
              inspection techniques, suggest that the SH1 mode in particular, at
              around 3 MHz $\cdot$ mm, would be suitable when testing for
              shallow defects; however, it is clear that both the SH0 and SH1
              modes can exist at this frequency–thickness product. This can
              complicate the inspection process and, therefore, limit defect

              the reflection coefficient of the SH1 mode, the pure SH1 mode can
              be used to detect defects as shallow as 5\% thickness loss from a

              The circuit consists of two novel current generators and an I/V
              conversion circuit with temperature compensation. Under the
              control of a proposed pMOS-bulk-driven (PBD) temperature

              act as resistors with different TCs and can be used for PTAT and

              is 0.09\% for supply voltages between 0.5 and 1.8 V. The PSRR

              high speed brushless application when high torque density (Tden)

              despite of stator leakage flux, high rare-earth PM usage, PMFSM is
              subjected to slot effects due to presence of both PM and CAW in
              stator and partial saturation due to double salient structure
              which generates cogging torque (Tcog), torque ripples (Trip) and

              mobile crowdsensing (MCS) to spring up. In a typical MCS system,
              the MCS platform recruits mobile phone users (workers) to perform
              the sensing tasks published by requesters. The requesters are
              interested in some urban events and are willing to pay for the
              sensing data returned by the workers. A lot of incentive
              mechanisms have been presented in the literature, in order to
              stimulate workers to participate into MCS campaigns or to maximize
              the social welfare. However, the community has not yet paid much
              attention to optimizing the platform profit, which is highly
              valued by the profitmaking MCS organizers. In this paper, we
              consider a realistic MCS scenario that depends on probabilistic
              collaboration among workers and has constrained capacity of
              platform; and we focus on the platform profit maximization (PPM)
              in this MCS scenario. The PPM problem is NP-hard, and the key
              challenge stems mainly from the non-monotonicity caused by the
              probabilistic collaboration and the quality-based payment of the
              requester. First, we propose two polynomial-time approximation
              algorithms for the PPM problem: MaxG and RandG. Our main effort is
              dedicated to design RandG, which involves a randomization policy

              chances of skipping over incompetent local optima. We also prove

              bacterial memetic algorithm (BMA) is applied to solve these
              problems in two different roles, as a supervised trainer, and as
              an optimizer. As a supervised trainer, the BMA is applied to tune
              two different WBG models. The bead geometry properties (BGP) model
              follows a traditional approach providing the WBG properties as
              outputs. The direct profile measurement (DPM) model describes the
              bead profiles points by a non-linear function realized in the form
              of fuzzy rules. As an optimizer, the BMA utilizes the developed
              fuzzy systems to find the solution sets of WPVs to acquire the
              desired WBG. The best performance is achieved by applying six

              amount of spatiotemporal trajectory data has been produced. One of
              the critical applications of trajectory data is location
              prediction that is important for urban traffic planning and
              location-based services. Although many methods for personal
              location prediction have been proposed, to the best of our
              knowledge, some users always have sparse historical trajectory
              data in practical applications, resulting in poor location
              prediction precision. Targeting on this challenge, we propose an
              Individual Trajectory-Group Trajectory (ITGT) location prediction
              model by utilizing the pattern of group travels. First, the model
              performs the stay point extraction and conducts the spatial
              clustering to construct the clustering link. Second, Fano's
              inequality and clustering link are used to evaluate the
              predictability of location. Third, two variable order Markov
              models, named prediction by partial match (PPM) and probabilistic
              suffix tree (PST), are adopted to predict the clustering link.
              Finally, our approach is evaluated by using 608 712 points from
              5000 volunteers at Shenzhen, China. The results show that: 1) when
              using individual trajectory, the PPM individual model is superior
              to the conventional N-order Markov model and PST individual model;
              2) when all group trajectories are used, the PPM group model is
              not as accurate as the PPM individual model; and 3) when it
              classifies the group trajectory into different traffic zones, the
              PPM zone model is better than the PPM group model and the PPM
              individual model. The prediction precision of 1-3 order PPM zone
              model is 83.21\%, 86.75\%, and 87.35\%, respectively, which
              introduces approximately 3\% performance gains by utilizing the
              characters of traffic zone groups.",

              gastric corpus. AIMS: To investigate the involvement of LGR5
              expression in gastric corpus ulcer regeneration in humans.
              METHODS: LGR5 expression was analyzed in five post-ESD ulcers
              during the healing process of regenerating epithelial cells of the
              gastric corpus. LGR5 expression was detected by mRNA in situ
              hybridization using an RNA scope kit. Immunohistochemistry of
              MUC6, HIK1083, and pepsinogen 1 (PG1) was performed to identify
              cell differentiation. RESULTS: We defined MUC6+/HIK1083-/PG1-,
              MUC6+/HIK1083+/PG1-, MUC6+/HIK1083+/PG1+, MUC6+/HIK1083-/PG1+, and
              MUC6-/HIK1083-/PG1+cells as pseudopyloric mucosa (PPM) phase 1
              (PPM1), PPM phase 2 (PPM2), PPM phase 3 (PPM3), immature chief
              cells (ICC), and mature chief cells (MCC) in order from the ulcer
              center, respectively. In the regenerated mucosa around post-ESD
              ulcers, LGR5 expression was observed throughout the gland in
              PPM1-PPM3, but it was limited to the bottom of the gland in ICC
              and MCC. Furthermore, LGR5 expression was not identified in the
              normal gastric corpus. The H-score of PPM2 was significantly
              higher than that of PPM3 (P = 0.0313). The H-score of PPM3 was
              significantly higher than that of ICC (P = 0.0313). The LGR5
              H-score was higher at the immature stage, which decreased
              gradually with progression of the differentiation stage.
              CONCLUSIONS: LGR5 expression appears to contribute to mucosal
              regeneration in the human gastric corpus. The application of LGR5
              expression analysis to mucosal regeneration and fundic gland-type
              gastric tumors is expected.",

  abstract = "Inhalation exposure to ozone (O(3) ) causes adverse respiratory
              health effects that result from airway inflammation, a complex
              response mediated in part by changes to airway cellular
              transcriptional programs. These programs may be regulated by
              microRNAs transferred between cells (e.g., epithelial cells and
              macrophages) via extracellular vesicles (EV miRNA). To explore
              this, we exposed female C57BL/6J mice to filtered air (FA), 1, or
              2 ppm O(3) by inhalation and collected bronchoalveolar lavage
              fluid (BALF) 21 h later for markers of airway inflammation, EVs,
              and EV miRNA. Both concentrations of O(3) significantly increased
              markers of inflammation (neutrophils), injury (total protein), and
              the number of EV-sized particles in the BALF. Imagestream analysis
              indicated a substantial portion of particles was positive for
              canonical EV markers (CD81, CD51), and Siglec-F, a marker of
              alveolar macrophages. Using high-throughput small RNA sequencing,
              we identified several differentially expressed (DE) BALF EV miRNAs
              after 1 ppm (16 DE miRNAs) and 2 ppm (99 DE miRNAs) O(3) versus FA
              exposure. O(3) concentration-response patterns in EV miRNA
              expression were apparent, particularly for miR-2137, miR-126-3p,
              and miR-351-5p. Integrative analysis of EV miRNA expression and
              airway cellular mRNA expression identified EV miR-22-3p as a
              candidate regulator of transcriptomic responses to O(3) in airway
              macrophages. In contrast, we did not identify candidate miRNA
              regulators of mRNA expression data from conducting airways
              (predominantly composed of epithelial cells). In summary, our data
              show that O(3) exposure alters EV release and EV miRNA expression,
              suggesting that further investigation of EVs may provide insight
              into their effects on airway macrophage function and other
              mechanisms of O(3) -induced respiratory inflammation.",

              amphibian field guides as identification character into species.
              Sometimes, this could lead to misidentification due to different
              formulas within one species. Hydrophylax chalconotus (Anura:
              Ranidae) and Duttaphrynus melanostictus (Anura; Bufonidae) are
              common anurans species around the human activity area such as
              garden, pool, and other habitats. This research was aimed at
              describing the development of labial tooth row formula (LTRF) of
              H. chalconotus and D. melanostictus during metamorphosis.
              Specimens were taken from several locations in Sleman Regency,
              Yogyakarta Special Province. This research was done by collecting
              and rearing tadpoles from eggs into larvae. The observation was
              conducted using stereo microscope. Premetamorphosis phase (stage
              17-35) was determined based on Gosner (1960), while LTRF was
              determined based on Iskandar (1995). The LTRF development of each
              species was noted and recorded. Results show that Jirst LTRF of H.
              chalconotus could be seen from stage 25 and gradually changed into
              complex structure until stage 35. Meanwhile, first LTRF of D.
              melanostictus could be shown from the stage 24 and remain
              unchanged until stage 35. Based on the observation, it can be
              concluded that the variation of LTRF was the result of
              development, and that some differences on same stages indicating
              variation within species. Thus, it is recommended that
              identification using LTRF should also consider the stage of the
              tadpoles development. This preliminary researh should be followed
              by similar research using different species. Kewords: tadpole,

              They were 9 species of amphibians and 11 species of reptiles. The
              amphibians were belong to Family of Ranidae, Bufonidae,
              Rhacophoridae and Megophryidae. Meanwhile, the reptile were member
              of Viperidae, Scincidae, Gekkonidae, and Agamidae family. After
              2008, the research was continued in 2009 and 2010 and
              significantly added I8 new recorded species to the list. The new
              recorded species consisted of 3 species of Rhacophoridae, 1
              species of Megophryidae, 10 species of Colubridae, 1 species of
              Scincidae, 1 species of Agamidae, and 2 species of Gekkonidae.

               for which many new processes and materials are currently being
               developed. The biggest advantage is that almost any shape can be
               produced, while conventional manufacturing methods reach their
               limits. Furthermore, a lot of material is saved because the part
               is created in layers and only as much material is used as
               necessary. In contrast, in the case of machining processes, it is
               not uncommon for more than half of the material to be removed and
               disposed of. Recently, new additive manufacturing processes have
               been on the market that enables the manufacturing of components
               using the FDM process with fiber reinforcement. This opens up new
               possibilities for optimizing components in terms of their
               strength and at the same time increasing sustainability by
               reducing materials consumption and waste. Within the scope of
               this work, different types of test specimens are to be designed,
               manufactured and examined. The test specimens are tensile
               specimens, which are used both for standardized tensile tests and
               for examining a practical component from automotive engineering
               used in student project. This project is a vehicle designed to
               compete in the Shell Eco-marathon, one of the world’s largest
               energy efficiency competitions. The aim is to design a vehicle
               that covers a certain distance with as little fuel as possible.
               Accordingly, it is desirable to manufacture the components with
               the lowest possible weight, while still ensuring the required
               rigidity. To achieve this, the use of fiber-reinforced 3D-printed
               parts is particularly suitable due to the high rigidity. In
               particular, the joining technology for connecting conventionally
               and additively manufactured components is developed. As a result,
               the economic efficiency was assessed, and guidelines for the
               design of components and joining elements were created. In
               addition, it could be shown that the additive manufacturing of
               the component could be implemented faster and more sustainably
               than the previous conventional manufacturing. © The Editor(s) (if

               fabricate customized tissue-engineered substitutes from
               biomaterials and cells for the repair or replacement of injured
               tissues and organs. A common challenge for 3D bioprinting
               materials is that the structures printed from the biodegradable
               polymer hydrogels tend to collapse because of the poor mechanical
               stability. In this study, dual stimuli-responsive biodegradable
               polyurethane (PU) dispersions (PUA2 and PUA3) were synthesized
               from an eco-friendly waterborne process. Acrylate group was
               introduced in the PU chain end to serve as a photosensitive
               moiety for UV-induced cross-linking and improvement of the
               printability, while mixed oligodiols in the soft segment remained
               to be the thermosensitive moiety. The photo/thermal-induced
               morphological changes of PU nanoparticles were verified by
               dynamic light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, and
               rheological measurement of the dispersions. It was observed that
               these PU nanoparticles became more rod-like in shape after UV
               treatment and formed compact packing structures upon further
               heating. With the thermosensitive properties, these UV-cured PU
               dispersions underwent rapid thermal gelation with gel moduli in
               the range 0.5-2 kPa near body temperature. The rheological
               properties of the PU hydrogels including dynamic viscoelasticity,
               creep recovery, and shear thinning behavior at 37 °C were
               favorable for processing by microextrusion-based 3D printing and
               could be easily mixed with cells before printing to produce
               cell-laden constructs. The dual-responsive hydrogel constructs
               demonstrated higher resolution and shape fidelity as well as
               better cell viability and proliferation than the thermoresponsive
               control. Moreover, the softer hydrogel (PUA3) with a low modulus
               (<1 kPa) could offer neural stem cells a tofu-like, stable, and
               inductive 3D microenvironment to proliferate and differentiate.
               We expect that the photo/thermoresponsive biodegradable
               polyurethane ink may offer unique rheological properties to
               contribute toward the custom-made bioprinting of soft tissues.

               from the traditional ground-based photo and video shootings of
               the selected Roman locations to the use of the modern unmanned
               aerial vehicles for obtaining low and high altitude photographs,
               video clips, as well as for the creation of ortho-photo images
               and 3D models. The paper investigates also the use of 3D scanners
               and photo cameras for the digitalization and the creation of 3D
               models of some of the most significant Roman artefacts and the
               printing of these 3D models as scaled replicas using modern
               eco-friendly 3D printers. The next section of the paper

              with many diseases such as cancers and heart disease, as well as
              altered physiological states. Because of their stability and
              disease resistance, circulation miRNAs appear to be an ideal
              material for biomarkers of diseases and physiological states in
              blood. However, the lack of a suitable internal reference gene
              (internal reference miRNA) has hampered research and application
              of circulating miRNAs. Currently, U6 and miR-16 are the most
              common endogenous controls in the research of miRNAs in tissues
              and cells. We performed microarray-based serum miRNA profiling on
              the serum of 20 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients and 20 controls
              to detect the expressions of U6 and miRNAs. Profiling was followed
              by real-time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) in 80
              patients (20 each with gastric cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma,
              colorectal cancer, and breast cancer) and 30 non-cancerous
              controls. qPCR was also performed to detect miRNAs in serum with
              repeated freezing and thawing. The results of microarray showed
              that with the exception of U6, Ct values of miR-16, miR-24,
              miR-142-3p, miR-19b and miR-192 in serum samples of nasopharyngeal
              carcinoma were greater than control samples. The results of 110
              cases showed large fluctuations in U6 expression. The difference
              between the greatest and the least levels of expression was 3.29
              for delta Ct values, and 1.23 for miR-16. The expressions of U6,
              miR-16 and miR-24 in serum subjected to different freeze-thaw
              cycles showed that U6 expression gradually decreased after 1, 2,
              and 4 cycles of freezing and thawing, while the expression of
              miR-16 and miR-24 remained relatively stable. Collectively, our

               environmental impact, based on geopolymer or cement CEM III

               of the concrete samples by micro- and macroorganisms and their
               durability were assessed after 1, 3 and 6 months of immersion.
               Results showed that both parameters were better with CEM III

               lags behind in terms of scale, effectiveness, and

               formation of carbonate skeletons on structural frames for

               the growth of scleractinian corals. Reverse engineering and

               approach from the use of concrete blocks and metal frames to
               sophisticated efforts that use scanned geometries of harvested
               corals to fabricate artificial coral skeletons for installation
               in coral gardens and reefs. Herein, we present an eco-friendly

               three-dimensional (3D) scanning, 3D printing, and molding

              ribosome biogenesis, thus, coupling Pol III activity to the rate

              a few Pol II-associated transcription factors have been reported

              routinely measured by standard quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR);
              however, the high sensitivity of qPCR demands appropriate
              normalization to correct for nonbiological variation. Presently,
              RNU6B (U6) is used for data normalization of circulating miRNAs in
              many studies. However, it was suggested that serum levels of U6
              themselves might differ between individuals. Therefore, no
              consensus has been reached on the best normalization strategy in
              'circulating miRNA'. We analyzed U6 levels as well as levels of
              spiked-in SV40-RNA in sera of 44 healthy volunteers, 203 intensive
              care unit patients and 64 patients with liver fibrosis. Levels of
              U6 demonstrated a high variability in sera of healthy donors,
              patients with critical illness and liver fibrosis. This high
              variability could also be confirmed in sera of mice after the
              cecal ligation and puncture procedure. Most importantly, levels of
              circulating U6 were significantly upregulated in sera of patients
              with critical illness and sepsis compared with controls and
              correlated with established markers of inflammation. In patients
              with liver fibrosis, U6 levels were significantly downregulated.
              In contrast, levels of spiked-in SV40 displayed a significantly
              higher stability both in human cohorts (healthy, critical illness,
              liver fibrosis) and in mice. Thus, we conclude that U6 levels in
              the serum are dysregulated in a disease-specific manner.
              Therefore, U6 should not be used for data normalization of
              circulating miRNAs in inflammatory diseases and previous studies
              using this approach should be interpreted with caution. Further
              studies are warranted to identify specific regulatory processes of

               regenerative medicine and require novel safe strategies for
               translation into the clinic. A non-viral osteogenic gene
               therapeutic vector system (‘hybrid vectors’) was generated,
               combining an improved bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) gene
               cassette and single pro-osteogenic microRNAs (miR-148b-3p,
               miR-20-5p, miR-590b-5p), driven by the U6 promoter. The vectors
               were tested in vitro for their osteogenic differentiation
               potential in C2C12 and C3H/10T1/2 cell lines, using BMP2 alone as
               control. After confirming BMP2 expression and miRNA
               transcription, increased osteogenic differentiation was observed
               by all hybrid vectors, but most consistently by BMP2/miR-590-5p,
               using alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity assays and osteogenic
               marker mRNA quantitation, including runt-related transcription
               factor 2 (Runx2), collagen type 1 (Col1a1) and osteocalcin. To
               visualise target mRNAs of the respective miRNAs, next generation
               sequencing was performed, confirming down-regulation of mRNA
               targets of the hybrid vectors. Since the hybrid vector consisting
               of BMP2 and miR-590-5p showed the largest increase in osteogenic
               differentiation in vitro, this was tested in a mouse ectopic-bone
               model. Mineralisation was more than with BMP2 alone. The present
               study showed hybrid vectors as a novel non-viral gene therapeutic
               plasmid system for combining therapeutic effects of recombinant
               protein expression and miRNA transcription that did not add to
               the burden of the translation machinery, while improving the
               therapeutic efficacies. In vivo proof-of-principle in the context
               of bone regeneration suggested that such hybrid vectors will be

              spliceosome disassembly involves large-scale structural
              rearrangements of U6 snRNA that are functionally important. U6
              enters the splicing pathway bound to the Prp24 protein, which
              chaperones annealing of U6 to U4 RNA to form a U4/U6 di-snRNP.
              During catalytic activation of the assembled spliceosome, U4 snRNP
              is released and U6 is paired to U2 snRNA. Here we show that point
              mutations in U4 and U6 that decrease U4/U6 base-pairing in vivo
              are lethal in combination. However, this synthetic phenotype is
              rescued by a mutation in U6 that alters a U6-Prp24 contact and
              stabilizes U2/U6. Remarkably, the resulting viable triple mutant
              strain lacks detectable U4/U6 base-pairing and U4/U6 di-snRNP.
              Instead, this strain accumulates free U4 snRNP, protein-free U6
              RNA, and a novel complex containing U2/U6 di-snRNP. Further
              mutational analysis indicates that disruption of the U6-Prp24
              interaction rather than stabilization of U2/U6 renders stable
              U4/U6 di-snRNP assembly nonessential. We propose that an essential
              function of U4/U6 pairing is to displace Prp24 from U6 RNA, and
              thus a destabilized U6-Prp24 complex renders stable U4/U6 pairing

              NMR-SAXS/WAXS approach for structural investigation of
              multi-helical RNAs. We illustrate this approach by determining the
              overall fold of a 92-nt 3-helix junction from the U4/U6 di-snRNA.
              The U4/U6 di-snRNA is conserved in eukaryotes and is part of the
              U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, a large ribonucleoprotein complex that
              comprises a major subunit of the assembled spliceosome. Helical
              orientations can be determined by X-ray scattering data alone, but
              the addition of NMR RDC (residual dipolar coupling) restraints
              improves the structure models. RDCs were measured in two different
              external alignment media and also by magnetic susceptibility
              anisotropy. The resulting alignment tensors are collinear, which
              is a previously noted problem for nucleic acids. Including WAXS
              data in the calculations produces models with significantly better
              fits to the scattering data. In solution, the U4/U6 di-snRNA forms
              a 3-helix junction with a planar Y-shaped structure and has no
              detectable tertiary interactions. Single-molecule Förster

              comparison with the recently determined cryo-electron microscopy

               the translational and mRNA processing (trans splicing) systems of
               trypanosomatids and other eukaryotes. In this context, certain
               small complexes of RNA and protein, which are named small nuclear
               ribonucleoproteins (U snRNPs), have an essential role in pre-mRNA

               defined in mammals, snRNPs are still not well characterized in
               trypanosomatids. This study shows that a U5-15K protein is highly

              Classically it can be viewed as a tiny magnetic moment, but a

              magnetic field can have only two outcomes: parallel or
              anti-parallel to the field. This discreteness reflects the quantum
              mechanical nature of spin. Ensembles of many spins have found
              diverse applications ranging from magnetic resonance imaging to
              magneto- electronic devices, while individual spins are considered
              as carriers for quantum information. Read-out of single spin
              states has been achieved using optical techniques, and is within
              reach of magnetic resonance force microscopy. However, electrical
              read-out of single spins has so far remained elusive. Here we

               responsible for the transcription of distinct subsets of genes.
               Gene-external type 3 Pol III promoters use defined transcription
               start and termination sites, and they are, therefore, widely used
               for small RNA expression, including short hairpin RNAs in RNAi
               applications and guide RNAs in CRISPR-Cas systems. We report that
               all three commonly used human Pol III promoters (7SK, U6, and H1)
               mediate luciferase reporter gene expression, which indicates Pol
               II activity, but to a different extent (H1 ≫ U6 > 7SK). We
               demonstrate that these promoters can recruit Pol II for
               transcribing extended messenger transcripts. Intriguingly,
               selective inhibition of Pol II stimulates the Pol III activity
               and vice versa, suggesting that two polymerase complexes compete
               for promoter usage. Pol II initiates transcription at the regular
               Pol III start site on the 7SK and U6 promoters, but Pol II
               transcription on the most active H1 promoter starts 8 nt upstream

               evidence for the close relationship of Pol II and Pol III
               transcription. These mechanistic insights are important for
               optimal use of Pol III promoters, and they offer additional

               RNA polymerase III uses a T-stretch as termination signal, but
               the exact properties have not been thoroughly investigated. Here,
               we systematically measured the in vivo termination efficiency and
               the actual site of termination for different T-stretch signals in
               three commonly used human Pol III promoters (U6, 7SK, and H1).
               Both the termination efficiency and the actual termination site
               depend on the T-stretch signal. The T4 signal acts as minimal
               terminator, but full termination efficiency is reached only with
               a T-stretch of ≥6. The termination site within the T-stretch is
               quite heterogeneous, and consequently small RNAs have a variable
               U-tail of 1–6 nucleotides. We further report that such variable
               U-tails can have a significant negative effect on the
               functionality of the crRNA effector of the CRISPR-AsCpf1 system.
               We next improved these crRNAs by insertion of the HDV ribozyme to

               improves both impaired SERCA2a controlled Ca2+ cycling and

               reported to cause cardiac toxicity in canines. Thus we developed
               a new AAV vector, scAAV6-amiR155-PLBr, expressing a novel
               engineered artificial microRNA (amiR155-PLBr) directed against
               PLB under control of a heart-specific hybrid promoter. Its PLB

               neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (CM) over a period of 14 days.
               Compared to shPLBr, amiR155-PLBr was expressed at a significantly
               lower level, resulting in delayed and less pronounced PLB
               silencing. Despite decreased knockdown efficiency of

               Ca2+ uptake into sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles was
               observed for both the shPLBr and amiR155-PLBr vectors. Proteomic
               analysis confirmed PLB silencing of both therapeutic vectors and
               revealed that shPLBr, but not the amiR155-PLBr vector, increased
               the proinflammatory proteins STAT3, STAT1 and activated STAT1
               phosphorylation at the key amino acid residue Tyr701.
               Quantitative RT-PCR analysis detected alterations in the
               expression of several cardiac microRNAs after treatment of CM
               with scAAV6-shPLBr and scAAV6-amiR155-PLBr, as well as after
               treatment with its related amiR155- and shRNAs-expressing control
               AAV vectors. The results demonstrate that scAAV6-amiR155-PLBr is
               capable of enhancing the Ca2+ transport function of the cardiac
               SR PLB/SERCA2a system as efficiently as scAAV6-shPLBr while

               surrounding the maritime region of Gibraltar Strait have been

               and dates of migration between close geographically related
               regions has been a challenge in the field of uniparental-based
               population genetics. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies have been
               focused on surveying the H1, H3 and V lineages when trying to
               ascertain north-south migrations, and U6 and L in the opposite
               direction, assuming that those lineages are good proxies for the
               ancestry of each side of the Mediterranean. To this end, in the

               U6, M1 and L haplogroups in Andalusians--from Huelva and Granada

               Peninsula regarding the time of origin, number of founders and
               expansion directions of these specific markers. The estimated
               entrance of the North African U6 lineages into Iberia at 10 ky
               correlates well with other L African clades, indicating that U6
               and some L lineages moved together from Africa to Iberia in the

               sharing of lineages between North Africa and Iberia results from
               a complex process continued through time, impairing simplistic
               interpretations. In particular, our work supports the existence

              factors involved in the assembly of the U4/U6 di-snRNP particle.
              Sad1 is required for pre-mRNA splicing both in vivo and in vitro,
              and its human orthologue has been shown to associate with U4/U6.U5
              tri-snRNP. We show here that Sad1 plays a role in maintaining a
              functional form of the tri-snRNP by promoting the association of
              U5 snRNP with U4/U6 di-snRNP. In the absence of Sad1, the U4/U6.U5
              tri-snRNP dissociates into U5 and U4/U6 upon ATP hydrolysis and
              cannot bind to the spliceosome. The separated U4/U6 and U5 can
              reassociate upon incubation more favorably in the absence of ATP
              and in the presence of Sad1. Brr2 is responsible for mediating
              ATP-dependent dissociation of the tri-snRNP. Our results
              demonstrate a role of Sad1 in maintaining the integrity of the
              tri-snRNP by counteracting Brr2-mediated dissociation of tri-snRNP

               responsive to cultural conditions in spike length (U6 from
               Xinjiang Uygur district of China) were grown under three cultural
               conditions with different seeding density and fertilization
               levels : 680 seeds m−2 without fertilizer (unfavorable), 340
               seeds m−2 with common fertilizer (common) and 170 seeds m−1 with
               double fertilizer (favorable). The durations of the vegetative
               phase, spikelet phase and the spike elongation phase were
               scarcely influenced by these cultural conditions, although the
               leaf number was influenced. The development of spikelets seemed
               to be determined by several factors other than those affecting
               the developmental processes of the spike. In U6, the increase in
               shoot apex length during the floral initiation period under the

               ridge number and spikelet number per spike, but such a

               showed a rather lower rate of spikelet formation under the
               favorable condition. Thus, the effects of the cultural conditions

               time of terminal spikelet formation, U6 tended to have a longer
               spike than T1 and Haruyutaka. However, since the rate of spike
               elongation was higher in T1 and Haruyutaka than in U6, the spike
               length at anthesis was shorter in U6.",

              nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), including U2 and U6 snRNAs, which are
              essential for catalysis. Human and yeast snRNAs share structural
              similarities despite the fact that human snRNAs contain numerous
              post-transcriptional modifications. Although functions for these
              modifications have been proposed, their exact roles are still not
              well understood. To help elucidate these roles in pre-mRNA
              splicing, we have used single-molecule fluorescence to
              characterize the effect of several post-transcriptional
              modifications in U2 snRNA on the conformation and dynamics of the
              U2-U6 complex in vitro. Consistent with yeast, the human U2-U6
              complex reveals the presence of a magnesium-dependent dynamic
              equilibrium among three conformations. Interestingly, our data
              show that modifications in human U2 stem I modulate the dynamic
              equilibrium of the U2-U6 complex by stabilizing the four-helix
              structure. However, the small magnitude of this effect suggests
              that post-transcriptional modifications in human snRNAs may have a

              factor IIIB and a proximal sequence element (PSE) recognized by
              the small nuclear RNA activating protein complex (SNAPc).
              Previously, we found that SNAPc (DmSNAPc) bound to the U6 PSE can
              recruit the Pol III general transcription factor Bdp1 to form a
              stable complex with the DNA. Here, we show that DmSNAPc-Bdp1 can
              recruit TBP to the U6 promoter, and we identify a region of Bdp1

              this same region of Bdp1 cross-links to nucleotides within the U6

              (sgRNA) in gene functional analysis in a variety of organisms
              including Schistosoma mansoni. However, no endogenous RNA
              polymerase III promoters have been identified in Schistosoma
              japonicum. The lack of appropriate promoters in S. japonicum has
              hindered its gene functional analysis. Identification of
              functional promoters in S. japonicum is therefore in urgent need.
              Via sequence alignment, a 347 bp sequence upstream from the coding
              region of S. japonicum U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) was
              identified, cloned, and named as S. japonicum U6 (sjU6) promoter.
              A sgRNA sequence named as sgRNA970 was designed, and its Cas9
              nuclease guiding activity was confirmed by in vitro cleavage
              assay. The sjU6 promoter was ligated with sgRNA970 coding sequence
              by overlap PCR to generate a sjU6-sgRNA970 expression cassette.
              The expression cassette was inserted into a lentiviral plasmid to
              construct the pHBLV-sgRNA970 plasmid. First, we tested the sjU6
              promoter activity in HEK293 cells by transfecting HEK293 cells
              with the pHBLV-sgRNA970 plasmid. RT-PCR amplification of the total
              RNA from the transfected HEK293 cells confirmed the presence of
              sgRNA970 transcript and indicated sjU6 promoter was functional to
              initiate transcription in HEK293 cells. Then we transduced the
              lentivirus expressing Cas9-ZsGreen fusion protein into 14 dpi
              schistosomula to test whether lentivirus was capable to induce
              exogenous gene expression in S. japonicum. Fluorescence microscopy
              and western blot results confirmed the expression of Cas9-ZsGreen
              fusion protein in S. japonicum. Therefore, this lentiviral system
              was adapted to test promoter activity in S. japonicum. Finally, we
              transduced 14 dpi S. japonicum with lentivirus produced from the
              pHBLV-sgRNA970 plasmid. RT-PCR amplification of the total RNA from
              transduced schistosomula confirmed the presence of sgRNA970

              In the current study, we set out to identify the RNA ligand(s) of
              a RRM-containing protein Tip110, also known as p110(nrb), SART3,
              or p110, using a RNA-based yeast three-hybrid cloning strategy.
              Six putative RNA targets were isolated and found to contain a
              consensus sequence that was identical to nucleotides 34-46 of U6
              small nuclear RNA. Tip110 binding to U6 was confirmed to be
              specific and RRM-dependent in an electrophoretic mobility shift
              assay. Both in vitro pre-mRNA splicing assay and in vivo
              splicing-dependent reporter gene assay showed that the pre-mRNA
              splicing was correlated with Tip110 expression. Moreover, Tip110
              was found in the spliceosomes containing pre-spliced pre-mRNA and
              spliced mRNA products. Nonetheless, the RRM-deleted mutant (ΔRRM)
              that did not bind to U6 showed promotion in vitro pre-mRNA
              splicing, whereas the nuclear localization signal (NLS)-deleted
              mutant ΔNLS that bound to U6 promoted the pre-mRNA splicing both
              in vitro and in vivo. Lastly, RNA-Seq analysis confirmed that
              Tip110 regulated a number of gene pre-mRNA splicing including
              several splicing factors. Taken together, these results
              demonstrate that Tip110 is directly involved in constitutive
              eukaryotic pre-mRNA splicing, likely through its binding to U6 and
              regulation of other splicing factors, and provide further evidence
              to support the global roles of Tip110 in regulation of host gene

               zebrafish was determined via whole mount in situ hybridization.
               Morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) aiming to knock down the
               expression of Snrnp200 was injected into zebrafish embryos,
               followed by analyses of aberrant splicing and expression of the
               U4/U6-U5 tri-small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) components

               phenotypes were further characterized by histological study and
               immunofluorescence staining. Results. Snrnp200 was ubiquitously
               expressed in zebrafish. Knocking down Snrnp200 in zebrafish
               triggered aberrant splicing of the cbln1 gene, upregulation of
               other U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP components, and downregulation of a
               panel of retina-specific transcripts. Systemic defects were found
               correlated with knockdown of Snrnp200 in zebrafish. Only
               demorphogenesis of rod photoreceptors was detected in the initial
               stage, mimicking the disease characteristics of RP. Conclusions.
               We conclude that knocking down Snrnp200 in zebrafish could alter
               regular splicing and expression of a panel of genes, which may
               eventually trigger rod defects.",

              assays, numerous issues with the selection of appropriate internal

              Identification of the distribution of U6 in different tissues is
              the premise of more accurate quantification of miRNAs. However,
              the distribution of U6 in human carcinoma tissues and

              suggest that the expression and distribution of U6 exhibits a high
              degree of variability among several types of human cells.
              Therefore, caution is required when selecting U6 as an internal

              splitting of chemical potentials (spin bias) is investigated
              theoretically by means of the Green's functions formalism. By
              applying a large spin bias, the quantum spin in a quantum dot (the
              dot 1) can be manipulated in a fully electrical manner. To
              noninvasively monitor the manipulation of the quantum spin in the
              dot 1, it is proposed that the second quantum dot (the dot 2) is
              weakly coupled to the dot 1. In the presence of the exchange
              interaction between the two dots, the polarized spin in the dot 1
              behaves like an effective magnetic field and weakly polarizes the
              spin in the nearby quantum dot 2. By applying a very small spin
              bias to the dot 2, the spin-dependent transport through the dot 2
              can be probed, allowing the spin polarization in the dot 1 to be
              identified nondestructively. These two steps form a complete

              manipulation to be monitored in the double-dot system using pure

               modern humans to colonize Eurasia from Africa have been proposed.
               These are the two natural passageways that connect both
               continents: the northern route through the Sinai Peninsula and
               the southern route across the Bab al Mandab strait. Recent
               archaeological and genetic evidence have favored a unique
               southern coastal route. Under this scenario, the study of the
               population genetic structure of the Arabian Peninsula, the first
               step out of Africa, to search for primary genetic links between
               Africa and Eurasia, is crucial. The haploid and maternally
               inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule has been the most
               used genetic marker to identify and to relate lineages with clear
               geographic origins, as the African Ls and the Eurasian M and N
               that have a common root with the Africans L3. Results To assess
               the role of the Arabian Peninsula in the southern route, we
               genetically analyzed 553 Saudi Arabs using partial (546) and
               complete mtDNA (7) sequencing, and compared the lineages obtained
               with those present in Africa, the Near East, central, east and
               southeast Asia and Australasia. The results showed that the
               Arabian Peninsula has received substantial gene flow from Africa
               (20\%), detected by the presence of L, M1 and U6 lineages; that
               an 18\% of the Arabian Peninsula lineages have a clear eastern
               provenance, mainly represented by U lineages; but also by Indian
               M lineages and rare M links with Central Asia, Indonesia and even
               Australia. However, the bulk (62\%) of the Arabian lineages has a
               Northern source. Conclusion Although there is evidence of
               Neolithic and more recent expansions in the Arabian Peninsula,
               mainly detected by (preHV)1 and J1b lineages, the lack of
               primitive autochthonous M and N sequences, suggests that this
               area has been more a receptor of human migrations, including
               historic ones, from Africa, India, Indonesia and even Australia,
               than a demographic expansion center along the proposed southern

               evolutionary mechanism based on the relative utility values
               realized by the two kinds of agents, we analytically and
               numerically investigate the existence of equilibria, their
               stability, and possible phenomena of coexistence between groups,
               mainly in terms of the heterogeneity degree in the preference
               structure. We find that our system has two trivial equilibria, at
               which just one of the two groups is present, and possibly a
               nontrivial equilibrium, characterized by the coexistence of the
               two groups of agents. Such nontrivial equilibrium may be stable,
               attracting all trajectories, or unstable. In the latter case,
               interesting, periodic, or chaotic, dynamics arise. We prove that

               the recently identified mRNA methylation complex containing
               METTL3, METTL14, and WTAP has been the subject of intense study.
               However, METTL16 (METT10D) has also been identified as an RNA m6A
               methyltransferase that can methylate both coding and noncoding
               RNAs, but its biological role remains unclear. While global
               studies have identified many potential RNA targets of METTL16,
               only a handful, including the long noncoding RNA MALAT1, the
               snRNA U6, as well as the mRNA MAT2A have been verified and/or
               studied to any great extent. In this study we identified/verified
               METTL16 targets by immunoprecipitation of both endogenous as well
               as exogenous FLAG-tagged protein. Interestingly, exogenously
               overexpressed METTL16 differed from the endogenous protein in its
               relative affinity for RNA targets which prompted us to
               investigate METTL16's localization within the cell. Surprisingly,
               biochemical fractionation revealed that a majority of METTL16
               protein resides in the cytoplasm of a number of cells.
               Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of METTL16 resulted in expression
               changes of a few mRNA targets suggesting that METTL16 may play a
               role in regulating gene expression. Thus, while METTL16 has been
               reported to be a nuclear protein, our findings suggest that
               METTL16 is also a cytoplasmic methyltransferase that may alter
               its RNA binding preferences depending on its cellular
               localization. Future studies will seek to confirm differences
               between cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA targets in addition to
               exploring the physiological role of METTL16 through long-term

               positioning, collected in 2018 and 2019, were used and aggregated
               according to a pixel-like pattern. The resulting dataset was
               split into a training one with 11,625 pixellated records and an
               independent validation one with 4952 pixellated records. The
               models were trained with a 19-fold cross-validation. A wide range

               (RMSE) of cross-validation ranging from 22.84 mm of CSH to

              efficiently to RNA, and (ii) a new group of RBP-associated factors

              non-Bravais lattices built up from elliptical dots is
              investigated. The Coulomb interaction between the dots is
              considered in dipole approximation. Then only the center of mass
              (c.m.) coordinates of different dots couple with each other. This
              c.m. subsystem can be solved exactly and provides magneto- phonon
              like collective excitations. The inter-dot interaction is involved
              only through a single interaction parameter. The relative
              coordinates of individual dots form decoupled subsystems giving
              rise to intra-dot excitations. As an example, the latter are
              calculated exactly for two-electron dots. Emphasis is layed on
              qualitative effects like: i) Influence of the magnetic field on
              the lattice instability due to inter-dot interaction, ii) Closing
              of the gap between the lower and the upper c.m. mode at B=0 for

              obtaining striking qualitative effects one should go beyond simple
              cubic lattices with spherical dots. We also prove a more general

              thereby allowing recycling. The mechanism of termination,
              including the RNA target of the DEAH-box ATPase Prp43p, remains
              ambiguous. We discovered a critical role for nucleotides at the 3'
              end of the catalytic U6 small nuclear RNA in splicing termination.
              Although conserved sequence at the 3' end is not required, 2'
              hydroxyls are, paralleling requirements for Prp43p biochemical
              activities. Although the 3' end of U6 is not required for
              recruiting Prp43p to the spliceosome, the 3' end cross-links
              directly to Prp43p in an RNA-dependent manner. Our data indicate a
              mechanism of splicing termination in which Prp43p translocates
              along U6 from the 3' end to disassemble the spliceosome and
              thereby release suboptimal substrates or excised introns. This
              mechanism reveals that the spliceosome becomes primed for
              termination at the same stage it becomes activated for catalysis,
              implying a requirement for stringent control of spliceosome
              activity within the cell.",

              where it has been shown to function as an intron splicing assembly
              factor. Here, RNP-4F is believed to initially bind to a
              recognition sequence on U6-snRNA, serving as a chaperone to
              facilitate its association with U4-snRNA by intermolecular
              hydrogen bonding. RNA conformations are a key factor in
              spliceosome function, so that elucidation of changing secondary
              structures for interacting snRNAs is a subject of considerable
              interest and importance. Among the five snRNAs which participate
              in removal of spliceosomal introns, there is a growing consensus
              that U6-snRNA is the most structurally dynamic and may constitute
              the catalytic core. Previous studies by others have generated
              potential secondary structures for free U4- and U6-snRNAs,
              including the Y-shaped U4-/U6-snRNA model. These models were based
              on study of RNAs from relatively few species, and the popular
              Y-shaped model remains to be systematically re-examined with
              reference to the many new sequences generated by recent genomic
              sequencing projects. We have utilized a comparative phylogenetic
              approach on 60 diverse eukaryotic species, which resulted in a
              revised and improved U4-/U6-snRNA secondary structure. This
              general model is supported by observation of abundant compensatory
              base mutations in every stem, and incorporates more of the
              nucleotides into base-paired associations than in previous models,
              thus being more energetically stable. We have extensively sampled
              the eukaryotic phylogenetic tree to its deepest roots, but did not
              find genes potentially encoding either U4- or U6-snRNA in the and
              data-bases. Our results support the hypothesis that nuclear
              introns in these most deeply rooted eukaryotes may represent
              evolutionary intermediates, sharing characteristics of both group
              II and spliceosomal introns. An unexpected result of this study
              was discovery of a potential competitive binding site for splicing
              assembly factor RNP-4F to a 5'-UTR regulatory region within its
              own premRNA, which may play a role in negative feedback control.",

              of TDP-43 knockdown on cell death, and slightly decreased the
              mis-splicing rate of Dnajc5 and Sortilin 1 transcripts, which are
              assisted by TDP-43. These results suggest that regulation of the
              U6 snRNA expression level by TDP-43 is a key factor in the
              increase in cell death upon TDP-43 loss-of-function.",

              crystallographic and biochemical analyses of human TUT1, which
              revealed the mechanisms for the specific uridylylation of the
              3'-end of U6 snRNA by TUT1. The O and O atoms of the UTP base form
              hydrogen bonds with the conserved His and Asn in the catalytic
              pocket, respectively, and TUT1 preferentially incorporates UMP
              onto the 3'-end of RNAs. TUT1 recognizes the entire U6 snRNA
              molecule by its catalytic domains, N-terminal RNA-recognition
              motifs and a previously unidentified C-terminal RNA-binding
              domain. Each domain recognizes specific regions within U6 snRNA,
              and the recognition is coupled with the domain movements and U6
              snRNA structural changes. Hence, TUT1 functions as the U6
              snRNA-specific terminal uridylyltransferase required for pre-mRNA
