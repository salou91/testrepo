  abstract = "We have carried out detailed time-resolved timing analyses of
              three cataclysmic variables (CVs) namely LS Cam, V902 Mon, and
              SWIFT J0746.3-1608, using the long-baseline, high-cadence optical
              photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite
              (TESS). Our analysis of LS Cam observations hints the presence of
              a superorbital period of $\sim$ 4.025$\pm$0.007 d along with
              negative and positive superhump periods of $\sim$ 3.30 h and 3.70
              h, respectively. These results can be explained as an interaction
              of nodal and apsidal precession of the accretion disc with orbital
              motion. For the other two sources, V902 Mon and SWIFT
              J0746.3-1608, we have found evidence of a beat period of
              2387.0$\pm$0.6 s and 2409.5$\pm$0.7 s, respectively, which were
              not found in earlier studies. Our results presented in this study
              indicate the change in the accretion mode during the entire
              observing period for both sources. For V902 Mon, an apparent
              orbital period derivative of (6.09 $\pm$ 0.60) $\times 10^{-10}$
              was also found. Moreover, the second harmonic of orbital frequency
              dominates the power spectrum of SWIFT J0746.3-1608, suggestive of
              ellipsoidal modulation of the secondary star. Present analyses
              suggest that LS Cam could be a superhumping CV whereas V902 Mon
              and SWIFT J0746.3-1608 are likely to be variable disc-overflow
              accreting intermediate polars.",

              parameters, including densities that are measured to span the
              range from less dense than styrofoam to more dense than iron.
              These densities represent a large diversity of interior
              structures. Despite this staggering diversity, recent analyses
              have shown that the densities of planets that orbit a common star
              exhibit remarkable uniformity. A fascinating exception to this is
              the system HIP 41378 (also known as K2-93), which contains a
              super-puff planet, HIP 41378 f, as well as several planets with
              more typical bulk densities. The range of densities in this system
              begs the question of what physical processes are responsible for
              the disparate planetary structures in this system. In this paper,
              we consider how the densities of the planets in the HIP 41378
              system would have changed over time as the host star evolved and
              the planets' atmospheres were subsequently affected by the
              evolving insolation level. We also present a range of allowable
              core masses for HIP 41378 f based on the measured planet
              parameters, and comment on the feasibility of the proposed
              existence of planetary rings around HIP 41378 f as an explanation
              for its current low density.",

  abstract = "Using smoothed particle hydrodynamics we model giant impacts of
              Super-Earth mass rocky planets between an atmosphere-less
              projectile and an atmosphere-rich target. In this work we present
              results from head-on to grazing collisions. The results of the
              simulations fall into two broad categories: 1) one main
              post-collision remnant containing material from target and
              projectile; 2) two main post-collision remnants resulting from
              `erosive hit-and-run' collisions. All collisions removed at least
              some of the target atmosphere, in contrast to the idealised
              hit-and-run definition in which the target mass is unchanged. We
              find that the boundary between `hit-and-run' collisions and
              collisions that result in the projectile and target
              accreting/merging to be strongly correlated with the mutual escape
              velocity at the predicted point of closest approach. Our work
              shows that it is very unlikely for a single giant impact to remove
              all of the atmosphere. For all the atmosphere to be removed,
              head-on impacts require roughly the energy of catastrophic
              disruption (i.e. permanent ejection of half the total system mass)
              and result in significant erosion of the mantle. We show that
              higher impact angle collisions, which are more common, are less
              efficient at atmosphere removal than head-on collisions.
              Therefore, single collisions that remove all the atmosphere
              without substantially disrupting the planet are not expected
              during planet formation.",

              induce anisotropies in the stochastic gravitational wave
              background. We derive the explicit form of such anisotropies by
              making use, for the first time in this context, of the in-in
              formalism for cosmological correlation functions. After
              illustrating the general method and using it for the minimal
              single-field slow-roll case, we apply it to multi-field models,
              providing both a tree-level and a one-loop example. First, we make
              contact with previous results on anisotropies due to the presence
              of an extra spin-2 field during inflation. Secondly, we calculate
              the 1-loop scalar-tensor-tensor three-point function in the
              context of so-called supersolid inflation. The corresponding
              gravitational wave anisotropy is induced atop a gravitational

              found to occur at the period of 1.689$\pm$0.001 hr which appears
              to be a probable orbital period of the system. Present photometric
              observations of SDSS J075939.79+191417.3 confirm and refine the
              previously determined orbital period as 3.14240928$\pm$0.00000096
              hr. The presence of long-duration eclipse features in the light
              curves of SDSS J075939.79+191417.3 indicates eclipses might be due
              to an accretion disc and bright spot. The orbital inclination of

              using the eclipse morphology. The phased-light curve variations

              emission from an independent second accretion region or a second

              ($\lambda$4686) emission lines, along with the detection of strong
              $H\beta$ emission lines with a large value of equivalent width.
