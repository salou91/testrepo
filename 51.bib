  abstract = "The census of known exoplanets exhibits a variety of physical
              parameters, including densities that are measured to span the
              range from less dense than styrofoam to more dense than iron.
              These densities represent a large diversity of interior
              structures. Despite this staggering diversity, recent analyses
              have shown that the densities of planets that orbit a common star
              exhibit remarkable uniformity. A fascinating exception to this is
              the system HIP 41378 (also known as K2-93), which contains a
              super-puff planet, HIP 41378 f, as well as several planets with
              more typical bulk densities. The range of densities in this system
              begs the question of what physical processes are responsible for
              the disparate planetary structures in this system. In this paper,
              we consider how the densities of the planets in the HIP 41378
              system would have changed over time as the host star evolved and
              the planets' atmospheres were subsequently affected by the
              evolving insolation level. We also present a range of allowable
              core masses for HIP 41378 f based on the measured planet
              parameters, and comment on the feasibility of the proposed
              existence of planetary rings around HIP 41378 f as an explanation
              for its current low density.",

  abstract = "We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of
              two Cataclysmic Variables (CVs), namely RBS 0490 and SDSS
              J075939.79+191417.3. The optical variations of RBS 0490 have been
              found to occur at the period of 1.689$\pm$0.001 hr which appears
              to be a probable orbital period of the system. Present photometric
              observations of SDSS J075939.79+191417.3 confirm and refine the
              previously determined orbital period as 3.14240928$\pm$0.00000096
              hr. The presence of long-duration eclipse features in the light
              curves of SDSS J075939.79+191417.3 indicates eclipses might be due
              to an accretion disc and bright spot. The orbital inclination of
              SDSS J075939.79+191417.3 is estimated to be $\sim$ 78 $^\circ$
              using the eclipse morphology. The phased-light curve variations
              during the orbital cycle of RBS 0490 provide evidence of the
              emission from an independent second accretion region or a second
              fainter pole. Optical spectra of RBS 0490 and SDSS
              J075939.79+191417.3 show the presence of strong Balmer, weak He II
              ($\lambda$4686) emission lines, along with the detection of strong
              $H\beta$ emission lines with a large value of equivalent width.
              The characteristic features of RBS 0490 seem to favour low-field
              polars, while SDSS J075939.79+191417.3 appears to be similar to
              the non-magnetic systems.",
