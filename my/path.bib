              were academically successful school completers (``resilient''
              students), school completers with poorer academic performance
              (nonresilient completers), and noncompleters (dropouts). Groups

  abstract  = "We extend the standard finance model of the firm's
               dividend/investment/financing decisions by allowing the firm's
               managers to know more than outside investors about the true
               state of the firm's current earnings. The extension endogenizes
               the dividend (and financing) announcement effects amply
               documented in recent research. But once trading of shares is
               admitted to the model along with asymmetric information, the
               familiar Fisherian criterion for optimal investment becomes time
               inconsistent: the market's belief that the firm is following the
               Fisher rule creates incentives to violate the rule. We show that
               an informationally consistent signalling equilibrium exists
               under asymmetric information and the trading of shares that
               restores the time consistency of investment policy, but leads in
               general to lower levels of investment than the optimum
               achievable under full information and/or no trading. Contractual
               provisions that change the information asymmetry or the
               possibility of profiting from it could eliminate both the time
               inconsistency and the inefficiency in investment policies, but
               these contractual provisions too are likely to involve
               dead-weight costs. Establishing which route or combination of
               routes serves in practice to maintain consistency remains for
               future research.",

              aldehydes that inhibit major peptidase activities of the 20S and
              26S proteasomes are shown to reduce the degradation of protein
              and ubiquitinated protein substrates by 26S particles. Unlike
              inhibitors of lysosomal proteolysis, these compounds inhibit the
              degradation of not only abnormal and short-lived polypeptides but
              also long-lived proteins in intact cells. We used these agents to
              test the importance of the proteasome in antigen presentation.
              When ovalbumin is introduced into the cytosol of lymphoblasts,
              these inhibitors block the presentation on MHC class I molecules
              of an ovalbumin-derived peptide by preventing its proteolytic
              generation. By preventing peptide production from cell proteins,
              these inhibitors block the assembly of class I molecules.
              Therefore, the proteasome catalyzes the degradation of the vast
              majority of cell proteins and generates most peptides presented
