               set upon epithelial differentiation is unknown. Given that tissue
               architecture also controls homeostasis, we investigated the
               relationship between basoapical polarity and resting MP in
               three-dimensional culture of the HMT-3522 breast cancer
               progression. A microelectrode technique to measure MP and input
               resistance reveals that the MP is raised by gap junction
               intercellular communication (GJIC), which directs tight-junction
               mediated apical polarity, and is decreased by the Na+/K+/2Cl-
               (NKCC, encoded by SLC12A1 and SLC12A2) co-transporter, active in
               multicellular structures displaying basal polarity. In the tumor
               counterpart, the MP is reduced. Cancer cells display diminished
               GJIC and do not respond to furosemide, implying loss of NKCC
               activity. Induced differentiation of cancer cells into basally
               polarized multicellular structures restores widespread GJIC and
               NKCC responses, but these structures display the lowest MP. The
               absence of apical polarity, necessary for cancer onset, in the
               non-neoplastic epithelium is also associated with the lowest MP
               under active Cl- transport. We propose that the loss of apical
               polarity in the breast epithelium destabilizes cellular
               homeostasis in part by lowering the MP.",

               developed a method to culture TOs under conditions that
               recapitulate the cellular orientation of chorionic villi in vivo.
               We show that culturing STBin TOs in suspension with gentle
               agitation leads to the development of TOs containing the STB on
               the outer surface (STBout). Using membrane capacitance

               machinery to achieve tissue-level movement. Biochemical signaling
               across leading-trailing cell-cell interfaces can promote this
               alignment by partitioning migratory behaviors like protrusion and
               retraction to opposite sides of the interface. However, how
               signaling proteins become organized at interfaces to accomplish
               this is poorly understood. The follicular epithelial cells of
               Drosophila melanogaster have two signaling modules at their
               leading-trailing interfaces - one composed of the atypical
               cadherin Fat2 (also known as Kugelei) and the receptor tyrosine
               phosphatase Lar, and one composed of Semaphorin5c and its
               receptor Plexin A. Here, we show that these modules form one
               interface signaling system with Fat2 at its core. Trailing
               edge-enriched Fat2 concentrates both Lar and Semaphorin5c at
               leading edges of cells, but Lar and Semaphorin5c play little role
               in the localization of Fat2. Fat2 is also more stable at
               interfaces than Lar or Semaphorin5c. Once localized, Lar and
               Semaphorin5c act in parallel to promote collective migration. We
               propose that Fat2 serves as the organizer of this interface
               signaling system by coupling and polarizing the distributions of
               multiple effectors that work together to align the migration
               machinery of neighboring cells.",

              positioning of the division boundary involves two mutually
              antagonistic factors: posterior CdaA (cyclin E) and anterior CdaI
              (Hippo kinase). Here, we characterized the related cdaH-1 allele,
              which confers a pleiotropic patterning phenotype including an
              absence of the division boundary and an anterior-posterior
              mispositioning of the new oral apparatus. CdaH is a Fused or Stk36
              kinase ortholog that localizes to multiple sites that correlate
              with the effects of its loss, including the division boundary and
              the new oral apparatus. CdaH acts downstream of CdaA to induce the
