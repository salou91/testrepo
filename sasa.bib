  abstract      = "Shapes of interacting RNA complexes are studied using a
                   filtration via their topological genus. A shape of an RNA
                   complex is obtained by (iteratively) collapsing stacks and
                   eliminating hairpin loops. This shape-projection preserves
                   the topological core of the RNA complex and for fixed
                   topological genus there are only finitely many such
                   shapes.Our main result is a new bijection that relates the
                   shapes of RNA complexes with shapes of RNA structures.This
                   allows to compute the shape polynomial of RNA complexes via
                   the shape polynomial of RNA structures. We furthermore
                   present a linear time uniform sampling algorithm for shapes
                   of RNA complexes of fixed topological genus.",
