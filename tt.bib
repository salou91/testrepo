  abstract  = "To detect differential item functioning (DIF), Rasch trees search
               for optimal splitpoints in covariates and identify subgroups of
               respondents in a data-driven way. To determine whether and in
               which covariate a split should be performed, Rasch trees use
               statistical significance tests. Consequently, Rasch trees are
               more likely to label small DIF effects as significant in larger
               samples. This leads to larger trees, which split the sample into
               more subgroups. What would be more desirable is an approach that
               is driven more by effect size rather than sample size. In order
               to achieve this, we suggest to implement an additional stopping
               criterion: the popular Educational Testing Service (ETS)
               classification scheme based on the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio.
               This criterion helps us to evaluate whether a split in a Rasch
               tree is based on a substantial or an ignorable difference in item
               parameters, and it allows the Rasch tree to stop growing when DIF
               between the identified subgroups is small. Furthermore, it
               supports identifying DIF items and quantifying DIF effect sizes
               in each split. Based on simulation results, we conclude that the
               Mantel-Haenszel effect size further reduces unnecessary splits in
               Rasch trees under the null hypothesis, or when the sample size is
               large but DIF effects are negligible. To make the stopping
               criterion easy-to-use for applied researchers, we have
               implemented the procedure in the statistical software R. Finally,
               we discuss how DIF effects between different nodes in a Rasch
               tree can be interpreted and emphasize the importance of
               purification strategies for the Mantel-Haenszel procedure on tree
               stopping and DIF item classification.",

               to examine the representation of human–nature relationships in
               Patrick Ness’s A Monster Calls (2011) and explores how the novel
               guides the child reader to an environmental mind-set beyond overt
               didacticism. The article focuses on two aspects of the bond
               between the magical tree and the human characters in the novel:
               how the powerful tree empowers humans and how the human
               characters contribute to the tree’s expressions of power. The
               eternal Green Man—as the tree introduces itself—embodies this
               bond by being simultaneously tree-like and human-like, a complex
               merger of “the Green” (nature) and “the Man” (humanity). The
               monster-tree fulfils several powerful and empowering roles, such
               as monster and storyteller, destructive force and powerful
               healer, savage and philosopher, nightmare and escape.
               Importantly, it always keeps the shape of a yew tree. As such, A
               Monster Calls can contribute to children’s environmental
               education by illustrating the connection between the natural
               environment and humans: the eternal bond between “the Green” and
               “the Man.”",
