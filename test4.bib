               is used for analyzing the effects of inputs on the system
               response and is commonly studied with analytical or surrogate
               models. However, such models fail to capture nonlinear behaviors
               in complex systems and involve several modeling assumptions.
               Besides model-focused methods, a data-driven GSA approach, rooted
               in interpretable machine learning, would also identify the
               relationships between system components. Moreover, a special need
               in engineering design extends beyond performing GSA for input
               variables individually, but instead evaluating the contributions
               of variable groups on the system response. In this article, we
               introduce a flexible, interpretable artificial neural network
               model to uncover individual as well as grouped global sensitivity
               indices for understanding complex physical interactions in
               engineering design problems. The proposed model allows the
               investigation of the main effects and second-order effects in GSA
               according to functional analysis of variance (FANOVA)
               decomposition. To draw a higher-level understanding, we further
               use the subset decomposition method to analyze the significance
               of the groups of input variables. Using the design of a
               programmable material system (PMS) as an example, we demonstrate
               the use of our approach for examining the impact of material,
               architecture, and stimulus variables as well as their
               interactions. This information lays the foundation for managing
               design space complexity, summarizing the relationships between
               system components, and deriving design guidelines for PMS
               development.",
