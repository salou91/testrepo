              pylorus, but there are few reports on its expression in human
              gastric corpus. AIMS: To investigate the involvement of LGR5
              expression in gastric corpus ulcer regeneration in humans.
              METHODS: LGR5 expression was analyzed in five post-ESD ulcers
              during the healing process of regenerating epithelial cells of the
              gastric corpus. LGR5 expression was detected by mRNA in situ
              hybridization using an RNA scope kit. Immunohistochemistry of
              MUC6, HIK1083, and pepsinogen 1 (PG1) was performed to identify
              cell differentiation. RESULTS: We defined MUC6+/HIK1083-/PG1-,
              MUC6+/HIK1083+/PG1-, MUC6+/HIK1083+/PG1+, MUC6+/HIK1083-/PG1+, and
              MUC6-/HIK1083-/PG1+cells as pseudopyloric mucosa (PPM) phase 1
              (PPM1), PPM phase 2 (PPM2), PPM phase 3 (PPM3), immature chief
              cells (ICC), and mature chief cells (MCC) in order from the ulcer
              center, respectively. In the regenerated mucosa around post-ESD
              ulcers, LGR5 expression was observed throughout the gland in
              PPM1-PPM3, but it was limited to the bottom of the gland in ICC
              and MCC. Furthermore, LGR5 expression was not identified in the
              normal gastric corpus. The H-score of PPM2 was significantly
              higher than that of PPM3 (P = 0.0313). The H-score of PPM3 was
              significantly higher than that of ICC (P = 0.0313). The LGR5
              H-score was higher at the immature stage, which decreased
              gradually with progression of the differentiation stage.
              CONCLUSIONS: LGR5 expression appears to contribute to mucosal
              regeneration in the human gastric corpus. The application of LGR5
              expression analysis to mucosal regeneration and fundic gland-type
              gastric tumors is expected.",

              chronic toxic effects of lead exposure on BF in Japanese quails
              (C. japonica) and the underlying mechanism of lead immunotoxicity.
              One-week old male quails were exposed to 0 ppm, 50 ppm, 500 ppm
              and 1000 ppm Pb concentrations by drinking water for four weeks.
              The results showed that Pb accumulation in BF increased in a dose
              dependent way. The growth and development of BF was retarded in
              500 ppm and 1000 ppm Pb groups. The number of lymphocytes was
              decreased and the release of immunoglobulin G and M (IgG, IgM),
              complement 3 and 4 (C3, C4) was inhibited by Pb exposure. Lead
              exposure also caused oxidative stress and increasing apoptosis in

              Our results show that long-term exposure to high As concentrations

              As resistance related genes in intestinal microbes. In addition,
              16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that As exposure significantly
              affected the Beta diversity of intestinal flora but had no
              significant effect on the Alpha diversity (except ACE index).
              Moreover, As exposure altered the composition of the intestinal
              microbiota from phylum to species. Non-targeted metabolomics
              profiling revealed that As exposure significantly changed the

              the changes in microbial communities and metabolites were highly
              correlated under As exposure. Overall, this study demonstrates
              that long-term exposure to high As concentrations disrupted the
              intestinal microbiome and metabolome, which may indicate the role
              of As exposure at inducing human diseases under similar

              have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viremia despite treatment
              with nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (nucleoside
              analogues) remains uncertain. We studied treatment with regimens
              that combined two nucleoside analogues, at least one of which was
              new, with the protease inhibitor nelfinavir, the nonnucleoside
              reverse-transcriptase inhibitor efavirenz, or both. METHODS: The
              study included 195 patients who had been treated with nucleoside
              analogues only, and had a plasma HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA level of
              at least 500 copies per milliliter. Patients were randomly
              assigned to receive, in addition to two nucleoside analogues,
              nelfinavir, efavirenz, or nelfinavir plus efavirenz. The primary
              end point was a plasma HIV-1 RNA level of less than 500 copies per
              milliliter at week 16. A secondary end point was the composite of
              the HIV-1 RNA levels measured at weeks 40 and 48. RESULTS: At week
              16 and at weeks 40 and 48, the proportions of patients in whom a
              plasma HIV-1 RNA level of less than 500 copies per milliliter was
              achieved were, respectively, 81 percent and 74 percent in the
              nelfinavir-plus-efavirenz group, 69 percent and 60 percent in the
              efavirenz group, and 64 percent and 35 percent in the nelfinavir
              group. Quadruple therapy resulted in a higher rate of viral
              suppression in both the short term (P=0.03) and the long term
              (P=0.001) than did triple therapy with nelfinavir. Triple therapy
              with efavirenz conferred a higher rate of long-term suppression
              than triple therapy with nelfinavir (P=0.004). Quadruple therapy
              also achieved a higher rate of virologic suppression than triple
              therapy with efavirenz (P=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In HIV-infected
              patients previously treated with nucleoside analogues, treatment
              with nelfinavir plus efavirenz and at least one new nucleoside
              analogue achieves a higher rate of viral suppression than do
              regimens with nucleoside analogues and nelfinavir or efavirenz
              alone.",

  abstract = "Magma volatile budgets and storage depths play a key role in
              controlling the eruptive styles of volcanoes. Volatile
              concentrations in the melt can be inferred from analyses of glass
              inclusions, which however may not be present in the investigated
              rocks or may have experienced post-entrapment processes that
              modify their volatile records. Apatite is becoming an alternative
              robust tool for unraveling the information of magmatic volatiles.
              Here we report a comprehensive dataset for the concentrations of
              volatiles and major elements in apatite crystals in the rocks from
              two eruptions with contrasting eruptive styles: the 2006
              (dome-forming) and 2010 (explosive) eruptive events at Merapi
              volcano (Java, Indonesia). We obtained two-dimensional
              compositional distributions and in situ concentrations of H2O,
              CO2, F, Cl and S in 50 apatite crystals occurring at various
              textural positions. The CO2 concentrations we report are probably
              the first ones from natural volcanic apatite. Using the volatile
              concentrations in apatite and existing thermodynamic models and
              geothermobarometers, we have calculated the volatile abundances of
              the pre-eruptive melts of the two eruptions. We find that the
              apatite from the 2006 and 2010 deposits have a similar
              compositional range of volatiles, with a bimodal distribution of
              F–H2O–CO2 contents. The apatite included in amphibole has higher
              H2O (0·9–1·0 wt \%) and CO2 (≥2400 ppm), but lower F (0·9–1·4 wt
              \%), compared to crystals included in plagioclase, clinopyroxene,
              or in the groundmass (H2O: 0·4–0·7 wt \%; CO2: 40–900 ppm; F:
              1·7–2·3 wt \%). Using these volatile concentrations and
              apatite-melt exchange coefficients we obtained two distinct ranges
              of H2O–CO2–S–F–Cl concentrations in the melt. Melts in equilibrium
              with apatite included in amphibole had 3–8 wt \% H2O, ≥8000 ppm
              CO2, 340–2000 ppm S, whereas melts in equilibrium with apatite
              included in anhydrous minerals and in the groundmass had lower H2O
              (1·5–4 wt \%), CO2 (60–2500 ppm), and S (10–130 ppm). We
              calculated the melt H2O–CO2 saturation pressures and found that
              they correspond to two main magma storage depths. The shallow
              reservoir with melts stored at ≤10 km below the crater agrees with
              the depths constrained by melt inclusions, as well as the
              geodetic, geophysical and seismic tomography studies from the
              literature. We have also found a significantly deeper melt storage
              zone at ≥25–30 km recorded by the C- and H2O-rich apatite in
              amphibole and barometry calculations using amphibole and high-Al
              clinopyroxene, which matches with the depths reported in seismic
              tomography studies. The high CO2/H2O and CO2/SO2 concentrations of
              the deep melt can help to explain the sharp increase in these
              ratios in fumarolic gas that were sampled just before the eruption
              in 2010. Supply of deep volatiles to the shallower magma column
              before the eruption in 2010 could have increased the magma
              buoyancy, and thus led to higher magma ascent rates and associated
              eruption explosivity. Evidence for the faster pre-eruptive magma
              ascent in 2010 than 2006 is also found on the diffusion distance
              of Cl in apatite microlites.",

              household products, petrochemicals, and cigarette smoke. Benzene
              is a well-known carcinogen in humans and experimental animals;
              however, little is known about the cardiovascular toxicity of
              benzene. Recent population-based studies indicate that benzene
              exposure is associated with an increased risk for heart failure.
              Nonetheless, it is unclear whether benzene exposure is sufficient
              to induce and/or exacerbate heart failure. We examined the effects
              of benzene (50 ppm, 6 h/day, 5 days/week, and 6 weeks) or
              high-efficiency particulate absorbing-filtered air exposure on
              transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced pressure overload in
              male C57BL/6J mice. Our data show that benzene exposure had no
              effect on cardiac function in the Sham group; however, it
              significantly compromised cardiac function as depicted by a
              significant decrease in fractional shortening and ejection
              fraction, as compared with TAC/Air-exposed mice. RNA-seq analysis
              of the cardiac tissue from the TAC/benzene-exposed mice showed a
              significant increase in several genes associated with adhesion
              molecules, cell-cell adhesion, inflammation, and stress response.
              In particular, neutrophils were implicated in our unbiased
              analyses. Indeed, immunofluorescence studies showed that
              TAC/benzene exposure promotes infiltration of
              CD11b+/S100A8+/myeloperoxidase+-positive neutrophils in the hearts
              by 3-fold. In vitro, the benzene metabolites, hydroquinone, and
              catechol, induced the expression of P-selectin in cardiac
              microvascular endothelial cells by 5-fold and increased the
              adhesion of neutrophils to these endothelial cells by 1.5- to
              2.0-fold. Benzene metabolite-induced adhesion of neutrophils to
              the endothelial cells was attenuated by anti-P-selectin antibody.
              Together, these data suggest that benzene exacerbates heart
              failure by promoting endothelial activation and neutrophil
              recruitment.",

              together with the intrinsic mobility of their users, has enabled
              mobile crowdsensing (MCS) to spring up. In a typical MCS system,
              the MCS platform recruits mobile phone users (workers) to perform
              the sensing tasks published by requesters. The requesters are
              interested in some urban events and are willing to pay for the
              sensing data returned by the workers. A lot of incentive
              mechanisms have been presented in the literature, in order to
              stimulate workers to participate into MCS campaigns or to maximize
              the social welfare. However, the community has not yet paid much
              attention to optimizing the platform profit, which is highly
              valued by the profitmaking MCS organizers. In this paper, we
              consider a realistic MCS scenario that depends on probabilistic
              collaboration among workers and has constrained capacity of
              platform; and we focus on the platform profit maximization (PPM)
              in this MCS scenario. The PPM problem is NP-hard, and the key
              challenge stems mainly from the non-monotonicity caused by the
              probabilistic collaboration and the quality-based payment of the
              requester. First, we propose two polynomial-time approximation
              algorithms for the PPM problem: MaxG and RandG. Our main effort is
              dedicated to design RandG, which involves a randomization policy
              of selecting workers in its greedy framework, aimed at pursuing
              chances of skipping over incompetent local optima. We also prove
              that RandG can achieve a constant approximation ratio in
              expectation. Second, we present algorithm RandCom for general PPM
              problems, which combines MaxG and RandG to struggle to make as
              high platform profit as possible. Finally, we conduct extensive
              simulation to evaluate our designs in terms of platform profit.",

              to different concentrations of dCO2 solution ranging from 10 to
              100 ppm. ZnO nanorice can adsorb dCO2 via strong hydrogen bonding

              amount of spatiotemporal trajectory data has been produced. One of
              the critical applications of trajectory data is location
              prediction that is important for urban traffic planning and
              location-based services. Although many methods for personal
              location prediction have been proposed, to the best of our
              knowledge, some users always have sparse historical trajectory
              data in practical applications, resulting in poor location
              prediction precision. Targeting on this challenge, we propose an
              Individual Trajectory-Group Trajectory (ITGT) location prediction
              model by utilizing the pattern of group travels. First, the model
              performs the stay point extraction and conducts the spatial
              clustering to construct the clustering link. Second, Fano's
              inequality and clustering link are used to evaluate the
              predictability of location. Third, two variable order Markov
              models, named prediction by partial match (PPM) and probabilistic
              suffix tree (PST), are adopted to predict the clustering link.
              Finally, our approach is evaluated by using 608 712 points from
              5000 volunteers at Shenzhen, China. The results show that: 1) when
              using individual trajectory, the PPM individual model is superior
              to the conventional N-order Markov model and PST individual model;
              2) when all group trajectories are used, the PPM group model is
              not as accurate as the PPM individual model; and 3) when it
              classifies the group trajectory into different traffic zones, the
              PPM zone model is better than the PPM group model and the PPM
              individual model. The prediction precision of 1-3 order PPM zone
              model is 83.21\%, 86.75\%, and 87.35\%, respectively, which
              introduces approximately 3\% performance gains by utilizing the
              characters of traffic zone groups.",

              (MCP) behavior in an atmospheric homogeneous dielectric barrier
              discharge (HDBD) in helium with air impurities. From the
              simulation results, we find that the O2 Penning ionization plays a
              leading role in the discharge characteristics. As the air content
              increases from 0 ppm to 5000 ppm, the current waveforms show a
              transition from a single-pulse mode to MCP mode, and the number of
              current pulses (Np) also increases. Through analysis, we find that
              although Np increases monotonically, the evolution mechanism of
              the MCP discharges under different ranges of air content is
              different. At lower air concentration (less than 500 ppm here), we
              find the similar explanation as that reported in our previous work
              on the MCP behavior only considering N2 impurity. However, when

              methods drastically increases the amount of both unigrams and
              bigrams. A previous procedure of flipping onsets has been proven
              to enhance the standard bigram-syllabification by relatively
              decreasing the syllable error rate (SER) by up to 18.02\%.
              Meanwhile, the previous swapping consonant-graphemes has been

              bacterial memetic algorithm (BMA) is applied to solve these
              problems in two different roles, as a supervised trainer, and as
              an optimizer. As a supervised trainer, the BMA is applied to tune
              two different WBG models. The bead geometry properties (BGP) model
              follows a traditional approach providing the WBG properties as
              outputs. The direct profile measurement (DPM) model describes the
              bead profiles points by a non-linear function realized in the form
              of fuzzy rules. As an optimizer, the BMA utilizes the developed
              fuzzy systems to find the solution sets of WPVs to acquire the
              desired WBG. The best performance is achieved by applying six
              rules in the BGP model and eleven rules in the DPM model. The

              analysis suggests that the BGP model estimates the BWG in a

              because of the complex geophysical properties. With good

              to be of great potential as the compromise solution between
              seismic and core. Since the “sweet-spot” depending on the sands'
              properties are implied not in the logging “point” but “segment”,
              1D-CNN is supposed to be a better fit for reservoir
              classification: It doesn't pay too much attention to the logging
              signal sequence itself like LSTM, but focuses on feature
              extraction from the whole signals combination. Moreover, samples
              would have various sizes because of different layer thickness.
              While 1D-CNN requires all samples must be converted to a uniform
              size before input. 1D fully convolutional network (1D-FCN) can
              receive any size input of layer thickness without manually
              aligning it to the same size. For the first time in this paper,

              Therefore, designing a new PPM is quite time consuming. In order

              rate-of-change of up to 32.4 GHz/s (168 ppm/s), which is ample to

              Simultaneous sensing of the two gases is useful for assessment of
              Helicobacter Pylori infection. This article introduces a
              multi-parameter optical fibre sensor by coating two different
              dyes, i.e., thymol blue and tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonic
              acid hydrate (TPPS) into one optical fibre sensing system for
              multi-sensing of the two gases. The dyes are separately coated on
              distal ends of a 2 × 2 optical fibre coupler using the sol-gel
              technique. The reflection spectrum contains distinctive absorption
              peaks of the two dyes in the wavelength domain and hence can be
              analysed using a single spectrometer. The absorbance at a
              wavelength of 608 nm corresponding to the absorption peak of the
              thymol blue exhibits an exponential decrease as the CO2
              concentration increases from 0 ppm to 60 000 ppm. The absorption
              bands at approximately 490 nm and 711 nm corresponding to the

              carbon cycle. The available GOSAT data, however, have many gaps
              and are irregularly positioned, which make it difficult to
              directly interpret their scientific significance without further
              data analysis. Spatio-temporal geostatistical prediction approach
              can be used to fill the gaps for global and regional Xco2 mapping.
              It is important to choose a suitable spatio-temporal variogram
              model since modeling spatio-temporal correlation structure using
              variogram model is a critical step in the geostatistical
              prediction. In this study, three different flexible
              spatio-temporal variogram models, including the product-sum model,
              Cressie-Huang model, and Gneiting model, are used to model the
              spatio-temporal correlation structure of Xco2 over China, using
              the Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space retrievals of the
              GOSAT (ACOS-GOSAT) Xco2 (v3.3) data products. The three models are

              (WMSE) indicating the fitness between the empirical variogram
              surface and the theoretical variogram model, cross-validation for
              quantifying prediction accuracies, and the performance of the
              three models when used to fill the spatial gaps and generate Xco2
              maps in 3-day temporal interval. The results indicate that 1) the
              model fitness of the commonly used product-sum model is slightly
              better than Cressie-Huang model and Gneiting model as indicated
              from WMSE, and 2) all the three models present similar summary
              statistics in cross-validation, all with a significantly high
              correlation coefficient of 0.92, and about 83\% of prediction
              error within 2 ppm and about 53\% within 1 ppm, and (3)
              differences between the mapping results using the three models are
              generally less than 0.1 ppm, and no significant differences can be
              identified. As a conclusion from the above results, all the three

              of the spatio-temporal correlation structure of Xco2 over China,

              calculate a reference for XCO2 over the ocean. The difference
              between XCO2 obtained using two means was less than 0.5 ppm.
              Moreover, the actual random error coincided well with the
              simulated random error, suggesting that our previous
              performance-evaluation model was reliable. This model predicted
              that a relative random error of less than 0.3\% would be very
              likely for the forthcoming satellite mission over land. However,
              measuring CO2 concentrations precisely over oceans was identified
              as a very challenging work. Improvements in hardware technology
              are unlikely to narrow this gap largely. Thus, developing
              dedicated algorithms to address CO2 measurement over oceans by
              using IPDA LIDAR is necessary.",

  abstract = "Inspection is a key part of the asset management process of
              industrial plants and there are numerous plate-like structures
              that require inspection. Ultrasonic guided waves have been
              extensively used to detect various types of defect by monitoring
              reflected and transmitted signals because they enable faster
              screening of large areas. However, ultrasonic guided wave testing
              becomes difficult for very shallow, sharp defects as current
              inspection techniques suffer from a lack of sensitivity to such
              features. Previous studies, obtained by comparing various
              inspection techniques, suggest that the SH1 mode in particular, at
              around 3 MHz $\cdot$ mm, would be suitable when testing for
              shallow defects; however, it is clear that both the SH0 and SH1
              modes can exist at this frequency–thickness product. This can
              complicate the inspection process and, therefore, limit defect
              detectability. This article investigates the possibility of a
              single-mode excitation of the SH1 mode at around 3 MHz $\cdot$ mm.
              The ability of this method toward detecting very shallow defects
              (<10\% cross-sectional thickness loss) has also been studied. By
              means of analytical predictions and finite element, it is shown
              that a signal dominated by the SH1 mode can be generated using a
              single permanent periodic magnet (PPM) electromagnetic acoustic
              transducer (EMAT) (PPM EMAT). All predictions are then backed up
              by experimental measurements. It is also shown that, by studying
              the reflection coefficient of the SH1 mode, the pure SH1 mode can
              be used to detect defects as shallow as 5\% thickness loss from a
              500-mm stand-off. These defects would otherwise be missed by
              standard, lower frequency guided wave testing.",

              health effects that result from airway inflammation, a complex
              response mediated in part by changes to airway cellular
              transcriptional programs. These programs may be regulated by
              microRNAs transferred between cells (e.g., epithelial cells and
              macrophages) via extracellular vesicles (EV miRNA). To explore
              this, we exposed female C57BL/6J mice to filtered air (FA), 1, or
              2 ppm O(3) by inhalation and collected bronchoalveolar lavage
              fluid (BALF) 21 h later for markers of airway inflammation, EVs,
              and EV miRNA. Both concentrations of O(3) significantly increased
              markers of inflammation (neutrophils), injury (total protein), and
              the number of EV-sized particles in the BALF. Imagestream analysis
              indicated a substantial portion of particles was positive for
              canonical EV markers (CD81, CD51), and Siglec-F, a marker of
              alveolar macrophages. Using high-throughput small RNA sequencing,
              we identified several differentially expressed (DE) BALF EV miRNAs
              after 1 ppm (16 DE miRNAs) and 2 ppm (99 DE miRNAs) O(3) versus FA
              exposure. O(3) concentration-response patterns in EV miRNA
              expression were apparent, particularly for miR-2137, miR-126-3p,
              and miR-351-5p. Integrative analysis of EV miRNA expression and
              airway cellular mRNA expression identified EV miR-22-3p as a
              candidate regulator of transcriptomic responses to O(3) in airway
              macrophages. In contrast, we did not identify candidate miRNA
              regulators of mRNA expression data from conducting airways
              (predominantly composed of epithelial cells). In summary, our data
              show that O(3) exposure alters EV release and EV miRNA expression,
              suggesting that further investigation of EVs may provide insight
              into their effects on airway macrophage function and other
              mechanisms of O(3) -induced respiratory inflammation.",

              Machines (PMFSM) with both Concentrated Armature Winding (CAW) and
              Permanent Magnet (PM) on stator attract researcher's interest for
              high speed brushless application when high torque density (Tden)
              and power density (Pden) are the primal requirements. However,
              despite of stator leakage flux, high rare-earth PM usage, PMFSM is
              subjected to slot effects due to presence of both PM and CAW in
              stator and partial saturation due to double salient structure
              which generates cogging torque (Tcog), torque ripples (Trip) and
              lower average torque (Tavg). To overcome aforesaid demerits, this
              paper presents Partitioned PM (PPM) Consequent Pole Flux Switching
              Machine (PPM-CPFSM) with flux barriers to enhance flux modulation,
              curtail PM usage and diminish stator leakage flux which reduces
              slotting effects and partial saturation to ultimately reduces Tcog
              and Trlp. In comparison with the existing state of the art,
              proposed PPM-CPFSM reduces 46.53\% of the total PM volume and
              offer Tavg higher up to 88.8\%, suppress Trlp maximum up to
              24.8\%, diminish Tcog up to 22.74\% and offer 2.45 times Tden and

              investigated utilizing space harmonics injection i.e. inverse
              cosine, inverse cosine with 3rd harmonics and rotor pole shaping
              techniques i.e., eccentric circle, chamfering and notching.
              Detailed electromagnetic performance analysis reveals that
              harmonics injection suppressed Tcog maximum up to 83.5\%, Trip up
              to 40.72\% at the cost of 4.71\% Tavg. Finally, rotor mechanical

              factor 2 (Nrf2) in acrylamide-induced neuropathy, male C57Bl/6JJcl
              adult mice were exposed to acrylamide at 0, 200 or 300 ppm in
              drinking water and co-administered with subcutaneous injections of
              sulforaphane, a known activator of the Nrf2 signaling pathway at 0
              or 25 mg/kg body weight daily for 4 weeks. Assessments for
              neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, oxidative stress as well as
              messenger RNA-expression analysis for Nrf2-antioxidant and
              pro-inflammatory cytokine genes were conducted. Relative to mice
              exposed only to acrylamide, co-administration of sulforaphane
              protected against acrylamide-induced neurotoxic effects such as
              increase in landing foot spread or decrease in density of
              noradrenergic axons as well as hepatic necrosis and hemorrhage.
              Moreover, co-administration of sulforaphane enhanced
              acrylamide-induced mRNA upregulation of Nrf2 and its downstream
              antioxidant proteins and suppressed acrylamide-induced mRNA

              co-treatment of sulforaphane provides protection against
              acrylamide-induced neurotoxicity through suppression of oxidative
              stress and inflammation. Nrf2 remains an important target for the

              for identification is labial tooth row formula (LTRF) from its
              mouthpart. This character was written and widely used in the
              amphibian field guides as identification character into species.
              Sometimes, this could lead to misidentification due to different
              formulas within one species. Hydrophylax chalconotus (Anura:
              Ranidae) and Duttaphrynus melanostictus (Anura; Bufonidae) are
              common anurans species around the human activity area such as
              garden, pool, and other habitats. This research was aimed at
              describing the development of labial tooth row formula (LTRF) of
              H. chalconotus and D. melanostictus during metamorphosis.
              Specimens were taken from several locations in Sleman Regency,
              Yogyakarta Special Province. This research was done by collecting
              and rearing tadpoles from eggs into larvae. The observation was
              conducted using stereo microscope. Premetamorphosis phase (stage
              17-35) was determined based on Gosner (1960), while LTRF was
              determined based on Iskandar (1995). The LTRF development of each
              species was noted and recorded. Results show that Jirst LTRF of H.
              chalconotus could be seen from stage 25 and gradually changed into
              complex structure until stage 35. Meanwhile, first LTRF of D.
              melanostictus could be shown from the stage 24 and remain
              unchanged until stage 35. Based on the observation, it can be
              concluded that the variation of LTRF was the result of
              development, and that some differences on same stages indicating
              variation within species. Thus, it is recommended that
              identification using LTRF should also consider the stage of the
              tadpoles development. This preliminary researh should be followed
              by similar research using different species. Kewords: tadpole,

              animals, these species are relatively easy to find in rural area
              (remote area). In addition to their high biodiversity value, the
              existence of these two groups of animals is also an important
              component of the ecosystem. The analysis of social paradigm in
              D.I.Y. region aimed to measure the communities? support towards
              and knowledge about the conservation of amphibians and reptiles.
              The survey was conducted in October- December 2013. The Location
              of the surveys included Gadjah Mada University (Kab. Sleman),
              Sermo Wildlife (Kab. Progo), Dlingo Village (Kab. Bantul), Kukup
              Beach and Ngandong (Kab. Gunung Kidul). The data collection was
              carried out using a questionnaire about amphibians and reptiles.
              The result showed that most respondents supported the existence of
              the amphibian and reptile conservation, but the communities?
              knowledge was still lacking in order to support the conservation.
              Law enforcement and legal awareness of some community groups and

              to the amphibians and the reptiles were partly antrophogenik and
              some of them were natural. In addition, on the regional scale, a

              maximal-ratio combining. The exact expressions for the bit error
              rate(BER) of this UWB system are firstly derived by using the
              virtual branch technique in term of PRF, the number of multipath
              components selected and combined L, and multipath spread of the
              channel and then this BER performance is evaluated. With the
              computer simulation for impulses having different pulse shapes,
              numerical results show that PRF, as well as pulse shape and the
              number of multipath diversity branches selected and combined L,
              has much effect on the BER performance of this UWB system in dense
              multipath fading environments. As PRF increases, the BER
              performance of this UWB system is much degraded under the
              conditions of fixed L and pulse shape.",

              systems under impulsive noise environment (INE) is investigated.
              At first, the Middleton's class a model is used as a model of
              impulsive noise (IN), we investigate the statistical
              characteristics of in-phase and quadrature components of IN, and
              it is proved that unlike Gaussian noise (GN), they are dependent
              especially to IN with small impulsive indices, Then, making use of
              this dependence between in-phase and quadrature components, an
              ovel UWB radio receiver designed for IN is proposed. The exact
              expression for the average BER (bit error rate) of this receiver,
              which is a function of SNR (signal to noise power ratio) and
              threshold value, is derived. Thirdly, we'll discuss the optimum
              threshold value. We'll also estimate the performance of UWB radio
              systems with the proposed receiver designed for IN and with the
              conventional receiver designed for GN in INE. Numerical results
              show that the performance achieved by the proposed UWB radio
              receiver is much etter than that of the conventional UWB radio
              receiver. Meanwhile, it is shown that both impulsive index and
              threshold value have much effect on the performance of UWB radio
              systems under the condition of INE.",
