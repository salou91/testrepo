  abstract = "The transport sector contributes around a quarter of global CO 2
              emissions; thus, low-carbon transport policies are required to
              achieve the 2 °C and 1.5 °C targets. In this paper, representative
              transport policy scenarios are structured with the aim of
              achieving a better understanding of the interaction between the
              transport sector and the macroeconomy. To accomplish this, the
              Asia–Pacific Integrated Model/Transport (AIM/Transport) model,
              coupled with a computable general equilibrium model (AIM/CGE), is
              used to simulate the potential for different transport policy
              interventions to reduce emissions and cost over the period
              2005–2100. The results show that deep decarbonization in the
              transport sector can be achieved by implementing transport
              policies such as energy efficiency improvements, vehicle
              technology innovations particularly the deployment of electric
              vehicles, public transport developments, and increasing the car
              occupancy rate. Technological transformations such as vehicle
              technological innovations and energy efficiency improvements
              provide the most significant reduction potential. The key finding
              is that low-carbon transport policies can reduce the carbon price,
              gross domestic product loss rate, and welfare loss rate generated
              by climate mitigation policies to limit global warming to 2 °C and
              1.5 °C. Interestingly, the contribution of transport policies is
              more effective for stringent climate change targets in the 1.5 °C
              scenario, which implies that the stronger the mitigation
              intensity, the more transport specific policy is required. The
              transport sector requires attention to achieve the goal of
              stringent climate change mitigation.",

              in the Paris Agreement typically rely on greenhouse gas emission
              reductions combined with net carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the
              atmosphere, mostly accomplished through large-scale application of
              bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, and afforestation.
              However, CDR strategies face several difficulties such as reliance
              on underground CO2 storage and competition for land with food
              production and biodiversity protection. The question arises
              whether alternative deep mitigation pathways exist. Here, using an
              integrated assessment model, we explore the impact of alternative
              pathways that include lifestyle change, additional reduction of
              non-CO2 greenhouse gases and more rapid electrification of energy
              demand based on renewable energy. Although these alternatives also
              face specific difficulties, they are found to significantly reduce
              the need for CDR, but not fully eliminate it. The alternatives
              offer a means to diversify transition pathways to meet the Paris
              Agreement targets, while simultaneously benefiting other
              sustainability goals.",

              limit global-mean temperature rise to 1.5 °C. The transition
              pathways that can meet such a target have not, however, been
              extensively explored. Here we describe scenarios that limit
              end-of-century radiative forcing to 1.9 W m−2, and consequently
              restrict median warming in the year 2100 to below 1.5 °C. We use
              six integrated assessment models and a simple climate model, under
              different socio-economic, technological and resource assumptions
              from five Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs). Some, but not
              all, SSPs are amenable to pathways to 1.5 °C. Successful 1.9 W m−2
              scenarios are characterized by a rapid shift away from traditional
              fossil-fuel use towards large-scale low-carbon energy supplies,
              reduced energy use, and carbon-dioxide removal. However, 1.9 W m−2
              scenarios could not be achieved in several models under SSPs with
              strong inequalities, high baseline fossil-fuel use, or scattered
              short-term climate policy. Further research can help policy-makers
