              Comput. 2015 , 11 , 2036 ) are reported. Electron correlation and
              basis set effects are systematically studied. The agreement
              between theory and experiment is in general satisfactory. For a
              subset of 16 molecules, the standard deviation between
              computational and experimental values is 9 kJ/mol with the
              maximum deviation being 15 kJ/mol. The discrepancies between
              theory and experiment remain substantial (more than 20 kJ/mol)
              for VH, CrH, CoH, and FeH. To explore the source of the latter
              discrepancies, the analysis used to determine the experimental
              dissociation energies for VH and CrH is revisited. It is shown
              that, if improved values are used for the heterolytic C-H
              dissociation energies of di- and trimethylamine involved in the
              experimental determination, the experimental values for the
              dissociation energies of VH and CrH are increased by 18 kJ/mol,
              such that D0(VH) = 223 $\pm$ 7 kJ/mol and D0(CrH) = 204 $\pm$ 7
              kJ/mol (or De(VH) = 233 $\pm$ 7 kJ/mol and De(CrH) = 214 $\pm$ 7

              into the dynamic responses of cells, but the quantitative
              analysis of morphological changes over time is a challenge. Here,
              we exploit the concept of ``trajectory embedding'' to analyze
              cellular behavior using morphological feature trajectory
              histories, i.e., multiple time points simultaneously, rather than
              the more common practice of examining morphological feature time
              courses in single timepoint (snapshot) morphological features. We
              apply this approach to analyze live-cell images of MCF10A mammary
              epithelial cells after treatment with a panel of
              microenvironmental perturbagens that strongly modulate cell
              motility, morphology, and cell cycle behavior. Our
              morphodynamical trajectory embedding analysis constructs a shared
              cell state landscape revealing ligand-specific regulation of cell
              state transitions and enabling quantitative and descriptive
              models of single-cell trajectories. Additionally, we show that
              incorporation of trajectories into single-cell morphological
              analysis enables (i) systematic characterization of cell state
              trajectories, (ii) better separation of phenotypes, and (iii)
              more descriptive models of ligand-induced differences as compared
              to snapshot-based analysis. This morphodynamical trajectory
              embedding is broadly applicable for the quantitative analysis of
              cell responses via live-cell imaging across many biological and

               that approximately 5.2 million Americans experience
               post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) each year. PTSD can be
               severely debilitating and diminish quality of life for patients
               and those who care for them. Studies have indicated that
               propranolol, a beta-blocker, reduces consolidation of emotional
               memory. When administered immediately after a psychic trauma, it
               is efficacious as a prophylactic for PTSD. Use of such
               memory-altering drugs raises important ethical concerns,
               including some futuristic dystopias put forth by the President's
               Council on Bioethics. We think that adequate informed consent

               proves efficacious, routine treatment. Clinical evidence from
               studies should certainly continue to evaluate realistic concerns
               about possible ill effects of diminishing memory. If
               memory-attenuating drugs prove effective, we believe that the
               most immediate social concern is the over-medicalization of bad

              considered to follow acoustic and chemical channels. However,
              many nocturnal birds have evolved intensely white plumage patches

              reflectance was ~30\% higher than the highest previously measured
              feather. This intense reflectance is the result of incoherent
              light scattering from a disordered nanostructure composed of
              keratin and air within the barb rami. In addition, the
              flattening, thickening, and arrangement of those barbs creates a
              Venetian-blind-like macrostructure that enhances the surface area

  abstract  = "Background: Therapeutic microRNAs (miRNAs) delivery holds a lot
               of promise for treating human malignancies. So, this study was
               carried out to examine the potential of miR-122 mimic and/or
               miR-221 inhibitor as an innovative therapeutic strategy for HCC
               in an animal model. Methodology: Mice were categorized into five
               groups comprising: (1) a normal control group, (2) an HCC group
               subjected to diethylnitrosamine (DEN) injection for 12 weeks,
               (3) a miR-122 mimic-treated HCC group, (4) a miR-221
               inhibitor-treated HCC group, and (5) a miR-122 mimic/miR-221
               inhibitor-treated HCC group. After 16 weeks, all animals were
               sacrificed and underwent biochemical, miRNAs and genes
               expression, histopathological, and immunohistochemical
               examinations. Results: The miR-122 mimic/miR-221 inhibitor
               combination dramatically reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory,
               liver cancer, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation markers when
               compared to either treatment alone. It also down-regulated the
               expression of cyclin D1, TGF-$\beta$, and $\beta$-catenin genes,
               which are involved in promoting cell cycle progression and
               cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, it caused the resolution
               of nearly all the histological malignant features as well as the
               reduction of malignant cellular markers, including
               $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin, arginase-1, and tropomyosin-1.
               Conclusions: The co-treatment with miR-122 mimic and miR-221
               inhibitor amplifies the benefits of either treatment on HCC
               through targeting the SENP1 and ARF4 genes, respectively. This
               combination can inhibit cancer cell proliferation and
               angiogenesis while inducing tumor apoptosis and necrosis. This
               study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of reversing a
               dysregulated miRNAs expression pattern in HCC. As a result,
               future research should concentrate on turning miRNA
               understanding into therapeutic applications.",

  abstract  = "Purpose: It is now known that traumatic injury initiates a
               complex and dynamic immune response on the first day. It is
               believed that in patients with polytrauma, these immune
               responses contribute to the development of infectious
               complications. Therefore, understanding the immune response to
               trauma is critical to improving patient outcomes through the
               development of new therapies and improved resuscitation
               strategies. The purpose of this study is to examine the
               parameters of immunity in patients with severe polytrauma at the
               stages of surgical treatment (the nearest post-traumatic period
               and long-term periods) in the absence and presence of
               purulent-inflammatory complications. Methods: We retrospectively
               enrolled 188 patients after severely injured trauma and 210
               control group at two Level-1 Trauma Centers. Peripheral blood
               was collected upon presentation to the hospital and at the
               following time points: 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 30, 60 and 90 days, and
               daily during intensive care unit admission. T-lymphocytes
               analyses performed using a Beckman Coulter EPICS XL flow
               cytometer (USA) with monoclonal antibodies (Immunotech, France).
               Analyses of protein levels of cytokines/chemokines,
               immunoglobulins, and circulating immune complexes was using
               ELISA. Results: Under the influence of trauma, the content of T
               lymphocytes decreased due to the population of T-helpers.
               However, the number of B lymphocytes increased. The most
               pronounced activation of humoral immunity was observed by the
               30th day of the post-traumatic period. Concentrations of
               interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis
               factor alpha (TNF-a), interleukin-10 (IL-10) on day 1 after
               injury were the highest. Later, in the post-traumatic period, a
               gradual decrease in the initially elevated cytokines was noted.
               Conclusions: As we continue to extrapolate new information on
               immune response factors associated with polytrauma, we will be
               better equipped to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat
               this serious clinical and social problem. In addition,
               individually adjusted immune control is an important interactive
               concept in polytrauma management.",

              includes a number of genes encoding small nucleolar RNAs (mainly
              C/D and H/ACA snoRNAs), which act as guides in the maturation or
              post-transcriptional modifications of target RNA molecules. Since
              in Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) only few examples of snoRNAs have
              been identified so far by cDNA libraries screening, integration
              of the molecular data with in silico identification of these
              types of genes could throw light on their organization in the Dm
              genome. RESULTS: We have performed a computational screening of
              the Dm genome for C/D snoRNA genes, followed by experimental
              validation of the putative candidates. Few of the 26 confirmed
              snoRNAs had been recognized by cDNA library analysis.
              Organization of the Dm genome was also found to be more
              variegated than previously suspected, with snoRNA genes nested in
              both the introns and exons of protein-coding genes. This finding

  abstract = "The similarity of two nucleotide sequences is often expressed in
              terms of evolutionary distance, a measure of the amount of change
              needed to transform one sequence into the other. Given two
              sequences with a small distance between them, can their
              similarity be explained by their base composition alone? The
              nucleotide order of these sequences contributes to their
              similarity if the distance is much smaller than their average
              permutation distance, which is obtained by calculating the
              distances for many random permutations of these sequences. To
              determine whether their similarity can be explained by their
              dinucleotide and codon usage, random sequences must be chosen
              from the set of permuted sequences that preserve dinucleotide and

              revealed an unprecedented degree of genomic variation and
              streamlining. With a size of 1.66 megabase-pairs, Prochlorococcus
              sp. MED4 has the most compact of these genomes and it is
              enigmatic how the few identified regulatory proteins efficiently
              sustain the lifestyle of an ecologically successful marine
              microorganism. Small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) control a plethora
              of processes in eukaryotes as well as in bacteria; however,
              systematic searches for ncRNAs are still lacking for most
              eubacterial phyla outside the enterobacteria.RESULTS:Based on a
              computational prediction we show the presence of several ncRNAs
              (cyanobacterial functional RNA or Yfr) in several different
              cyanobacteria of the Prochlorococcus-Synechococcus lineage. Some
              ncRNA genes are present only in two or three of the four strains
              investigated, whereas the RNAs Yfr2 through Yfr5 are structurally
              highly related and are encoded by a rapidly evolving gene family
              as their genes exist in different copy numbers and at different
              sites in the four investigated genomes. One ncRNA, Yfr7, is
              present in at least seven other cyanobacteria. In addition,
              control elements for several ribosomal operons were predicted as
              well as riboswitches for thiamine pyrophosphate and
              cobalamin.CONCLUSION:This is the first genome-wide and systematic
              screen for ncRNAs in cyanobacteria. Several ncRNAs were both
              computationally predicted and their presence was biochemically
              verified. These RNAs may have regulatory functions and each shows
              a distinct phylogenetic distribution. Our approach can be applied

              bacteriophage phi 29 is a structural component of the viral
              prohead and is required for the ATP-dependent packaging of DNA.
              Here we report a model of secondary structure for this prohead
              RNA developed from a phylogenetic analysis of the primary
              sequences of prohead RNAs of related phages. Twenty-nine phages
              related to phi 29 were found to produce prohead RNAs. These RNAs
              were analyzed by their ability to replace phi 29 RNA in in vitro
              phage assembly, by Northern blot hybridization with a probe
              complementary to phi 29 RNA, and by partial and complete sequence
              analyses. These analyses revealed four quite different sequences
              ranging in length from 161 to 174 residues. The secondary
              structure deduced from these sequences, in agreement with earlier
              observations, indicated that prohead RNA is organized into two
              domains. The larger 5'-domain (Domain I) is composed of 113-117
              residues and contains four helices. Three of these helices appear
              to be organized into a central stem that is interrupted by two
              unpaired loops and the fourth helix and loop. The smaller
              3'-domain (Domain II) is composed of 40-44 residues and consists
              of two helices. Domains I and II are separated by 8-13 unpaired
              residues. Nuclease cleavage occurs readily in this
              single-stranded joining region, and this cleavage allows the
              subsequent separation of the two RNA domains. The separated
              Domain I is fully active in DNA packaging in vitro. The
              functional significance and biological role of Domain II are
              unknown. The phylogenetic secondary structure model provides a
              basis for further analysis of the role of this RNA in
              bacteriophage morphogenesis.",

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: It is currently believed that the human genome
              contains about twice as much non-coding functional regions as it
              does protein-coding genes, yet our understanding of these regions
              is very limited. RESULTS: We examine the intersection between
              syntenically conserved sequences in the human, mouse and rat
              genomes, and sequence similarities within the human genome
              itself, in search of families of non-protein-coding elements. For
              this purpose we develop a graph theoretic clustering algorithm,
              akin to the highly successful methods used in elucidating protein
              sequence family relationships. The algorithm is applied to a
              highly filtered set of about 700 000 human-rodent evolutionarily
              conserved regions, not resembling any known coding sequence,
              which encompasses 3.7\% of the human genome. From these, we
              obtain roughly 12 000 non-singleton clusters, dense in
              significant sequence similarities. Further analysis of genomic
              location, evidence of transcription and RNA secondary structure
              reveals many clusters to be significantly homogeneous in one or
              more characteristics. This subset of the highly conserved
              non-protein-coding elements in the human genome thus contains
              rich family-like structures, which merit in-depth analysis.

              specifically regulate cellular gene expression at the
              post-transcriptional level. miRNAs are derived from the
              maturation by cellular RNases III of imperfect stem loop
              structures of 70 nucleotides. Evidence for hundreds of miRNAs and
              their corresponding targets has been reported in the literature
              for plants, insects, invertebrate animals, and mammals. While not
              all of these miRNA/target pairs have been functionally verified,
              some clearly serve roles in regulating normal development and

              human viruses like their cellular counterpart also encode miRNA.
              To date, there has been only one report pertaining to this
              question. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been shown to encode
              five miRNAs. Here, we extend the analysis of miRNA-encoding

              computer-directed analyses, we found that HIV putatively encodes
              five candidate pre-miRNAs. We then matched deduced mature miRNA
              sequences from these 5 pre-miRNAs against a database of 3'
              untranslated sequences (UTR) from the human genome. These

              common features among known RNAs for prediction of new RNA genes
              in the unannotated regions of prokaryotic and archaeal genomes.
              The Escherichia coli genome was used for development, but we have
              applied this method to several other bacterial and archaeal
              genomes. Networks based on nucleotide composition were 80-90\%
              accurate in jackknife testing experiments for bacteria and
              90-99\% for hyperthermophilic archaea. We also achieved a

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: micF RNA, a small regulatory RNA found in bacteria,
              post-transcriptionally regulates expression of outer membrane
              protein F (OmpF) by interaction with the ompF mRNA 5'UTR.
              Phylogenetic data can be useful for RNA/RNA duplex structure
              analyses and aid in elucidation of mechanism of regulation.
              However micF and associated genes, ompF and ompC are difficult to
              annotate because of either similarities or divergences in
              nucleotide sequence. We report by using sequences that represent
              ``gene signatures'' as probes, e.g., mRNA 5'UTR sequences,
              closely related genes can be accurately located in genomic
              sequences. RESULTS: Alignment and search methods using NCBI BLAST
              programs have been used to identify micF, ompF and ompC in
              Yersinia pestis and Yersinia enterocolitica. By alignment with
              DNA sequences from other bacterial species, 5' start sites of
              genes and upstream transcriptional regulatory sites in promoter
              regions were predicted. Annotated genes from Yersinia species
              provide phylogenetic information on the micF regulatory system.
              High sequence conservation in binding sites of transcriptional
              regulatory factors are found in the promoter region upstream of
              micF and conservation in blocks of sequences as well as marked
              sequence variation is seen in segments of the micF RNA gene.
              Unexpected large differences in rates of evolution were found
              between the interacting RNA transcripts, micF RNA and the 5' UTR
              of the ompF mRNA. micF RNA/ompF mRNA 5' UTR duplex structures
              were modeled by the mfold program. Functional domains such as
              RNA/RNA interacting sites appear to display a minimum of
              evolutionary drift in sequence with the exception of a
              significant change in Y. enterocolitica micF RNA. CONCLUSIONS:
              Newly annotated Yersinia micF and ompF genes and the resultant
              RNA/RNA duplex structures add strong phylogenetic support for a
              generalized duplex model. The alignment and search approach using
              5' UTR signatures may be a model to help define other genes and
              their start sites when annotated genes are available in
              well-defined reference organisms.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: RNA secondary structure prediction methods based on
              probabilistic modeling can be developed using stochastic
              context-free grammars (SCFGs). Such methods can readily combine
              different sources of information that can be expressed
              probabilistically, such as an evolutionary model of comparative
              RNA sequence analysis and a biophysical model of structure
              plausibility. However, the number of free parameters in an
              integrated model for consensus RNA structure prediction can
              become untenable if the underlying SCFG design is too complex.
              Thus a key question is, what small, simple SCFG designs perform
              best for RNA secondary structure prediction? RESULTS: Nine
              different small SCFGs were implemented to explore the tradeoffs
              between model complexity and prediction accuracy. Each model was
              tested for single sequence structure prediction accuracy on a
              benchmark set of RNA secondary structures. CONCLUSIONS: Four SCFG
              designs had prediction accuracies near the performance of current
              energy minimization programs. One of these designs, introduced by
              Knudsen and Hein in their PFOLD algorithm, has only 21 free
              parameters and is significantly simpler than the others.",

              screen the yeast genome for novel H/ACA snoRNAs. To achieve this,
              we introduce some new methods for facilitating the search for
              noncoding RNAs in genomic sequences which are based on properties
              of predicted minimum free-energy (MFE) secondary structures. The
              algorithm has been implemented and can be generalized to enable
              screening of other eukaryote genomes. We find that use of primary
              sequence alone is insufficient for identifying novel H/ACA

              the sequences, together with annotations of genes, regulatory
              sites and conserved regions. The third, a Java-based tool named

              algorithms upon nucleic acid sequences. Frequently, sophisticated
              PAM or BLOSUM like models are used to align proteins, yet
              equivalents are not considered for nucleic acids; instead, rather
              ad hoc models are generally favoured. Here, we systematically
              test the performance of existing alignment algorithms on
              structural RNAs. This work was aimed at achieving the following
              goals: (i) to determine conditions where it is appropriate to
              apply common sequence alignment methods to the structural RNA
              alignment problem. This indicates where and when researchers
              should consider augmenting the alignment process with auxiliary
              information, such as secondary structure and (ii) to determine
              which sequence alignment algorithms perform well under the
              broadest range of conditions. We find that sequence alignment
              alone, using the current algorithms, is generally inappropriate
              <50-60\% sequence identity. Second, we note that the
              probabilistic method ProAlign and the aging Clustal algorithms

  abstract = "We present here a new approach to the problem of defining RNA
              signatures and finding their occurrences in sequence databases.
              The proposed method is based on ``secondary structure profiles''.
              An RNA sequence alignment with secondary structure information is
              used as an input. Two types of weight matrices/profiles are
              constructed from this alignment: single strands are represented
              by a classical lod-scores profile while helical regions are
              represented by an extended ``helical profile'' comprising 16
              lod-scores per position, one for each of the 16 possible
              base-pairs. Database searches are then conducted using a
              simultaneous search for helical profiles and dynamic programming
              alignment of single strand profiles. The algorithm has been
              implemented into a new software, ERPIN, that performs both
              profile construction and database search. Applications are
              presented for several RNA motifs. The automated use of sequence
              information in both single-stranded and helical regions yields
              better sensitivity/specificity ratios than descriptor-based
              programs. Furthermore, since the translation of alignments into
              profiles is straightforward with ERPIN, iterative searches can
              easily be conducted to enrich collections of homologous RNAs.",

              sequences in noncoding regions of human, mouse, and rat genomes
              that appear to be essential for vertebrate and amniote ontogeny.
              Here, we used similar methods to identify ultraconserved genomic
              regions between the insect species Drosophila melanogaster and
              Drosophila pseudoobscura, as well as the more distantly related
              Anopheles gambiae. As with vertebrates, ultraconserved sequences
              in insects appear to occur primarily in intergenic and intronic
              sequences, and at intron-exon junctions. The sequences are
              significantly associated with genes encoding developmental
              regulators and transcription factors, but are less frequent and
              are smaller in size than in vertebrates. The longest identical,
              nongapped orthologous match between the three genomes was found
              within the homothorax (hth) gene. This sequence spans an internal
              exon-intron junction, with the majority located within the
              intron, and is predicted to form a highly stable stem-loop RNA
              structure. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of different hth
              splice isoforms and Northern blotting showed that the conserved
              element is associated with a high incidence of intron retention
              in hth pre-mRNA, suggesting that the conserved intronic element

              bacterial virus phi29, an RNA (pRNA) molecule is a vital
              component of this motor. This 120-base RNA has many novel and

              perform versatile function. It can be easily manipulated to form

              cellular level, the basic molecular framework for the regulation
              of iron uptake, storage, and utilization has been defined. Two
              cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins, iron-regulatory protein-1
              (IRP-1) and IRP-2, respond to changes in cellular iron
              availability and coordinate the expression of mRNAs that harbor

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Recently novel classes of functional RNAs, most
              prominently the miRNAs have been discovered, strongly suggesting
              that further types of functional RNAs are still hidden in the
              recently completed genomic DNA sequences. Only few techniques are
              known, however, to survey genomes for such RNA genes. When
              sufficiently similar sequences are not available for comparative
              approaches the only known remedy is to search directly for
              structural features. RESULTS: We present here efficient
              algorithms for computing locally stable RNA structures at
              genome-wide scales. Both the minimum energy structure and the
              complete matrix of base pairing probabilities can be computed in
              O(N x L(2)) time and O(N + L(2)) memory in terms of the length N
              of the genome and the size L of the largest secondary structure
              motifs of interest. In practice, the 100 Mb of the complete
              genome of Caenorhabditis elegans can be folded within about half
              a day on a modern PC with a search depth of L = 100. This is
              sufficient example for a survey for miRNAs. AVAILABILITY: The

  title    = "Alignment of {RNA} base pairing probability matrices",
  author   = "Hofacker, I L and Bernhart, S H and Stadler, P F",
  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Many classes of functional RNA molecules are
              characterized by highly conserved secondary structures but little
              detectable sequence similarity. Reliable multiple alignments can
              therefore be constructed only when the shared structural features
              are taken into account. Since multiple alignments are used as
              input for many subsequent methods of data analysis, structure
              based alignments are an indispensable necessity in RNA
              bioinformatics. RESULTS: We present here a method to compute
              pairwise and progressive multiple alignments from the direct
              comparison of basepairing probability matrices. Instead of
              attempting to solve the folding and the alignment problem
              simultaneously as in the classical Sankoff algorithm we use
              McCaskill's approach to compute base pairing probability matrices
              which effectively incorporate the information on the energetics
              of each sequences. A novel, simplified variant of Sankoff's
              algorithms can then be employed to extract the maximum weight
              common secondary structure and an associated alignment.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Pairwise stochastic context-free grammars (Pair
              SCFGs) are powerful tools for evolutionary analysis of RNA,
              including simultaneous RNA sequence alignment and secondary
              structure prediction, but the associated algorithms are intensive
              in both CPU and memory usage. The same problem is faced by other
              RNA alignment-and-folding algorithms based on Sankoff's 1985
              algorithm. It is therefore desirable to constrain such
              algorithms, by pre-processing the sequences and using this first
              pass to limit the range of structures and/or alignments that can
              be considered. RESULTS: We demonstrate how flexible classes of
              constraint can be imposed, greatly reducing the computational
              costs while maintaining a high quality of structural homology
              prediction. Any score-attributed context-free grammar (e.g.
              energy-based scoring schemes, or conditionally normalized Pair
              SCFGs) is amenable to this treatment. It is now possible to
              combine independent structural and alignment constraints of
              unprecedented general flexibility in Pair SCFG alignment
              algorithms. We outline several applications to the bioinformatics
              of RNA sequence and structure, including Waterman-Eggert N-best
              alignments and progressive multiple alignment. We evaluate the
              performance of the algorithm on test examples from the RFAM
              database. CONCLUSION: A program, Stemloc, that implements these

              predicted target sites on the 3' untranslated regions of human
              gene transcripts for all currently known 218 mammalian miRNAs to
              facilitate focused experiments. We report about 2,000 human genes

              genes conserved as targets between mammals and fish. The

              position-specific rules and relies on strict requirements of
              interspecies conservation. Experimental support for the validity

              we describe a novel combination of techniques including the rapid
              amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and tiling array technologies
              that was used to further characterize transcripts in the human
              transcriptome. This technical approach allows for several
              important pieces of information to be gathered about each
              array-detected transcribed region, including strand of origin,
              start and termination positions, and the exonic structures of
              spliced and unspliced coding and noncoding RNAs. In this report,
              the structures of transcripts from 14 transcribed loci,
              representing both known genes and unannotated transcripts taken
              from the several hundred randomly selected unannotated
              transcripts described in our previous work are represented as
              examples of the complex organization of the human transcriptome.
              As a consequence of this complexity, it is not unusual that a
              single base pair can be part of an intricate network of multiple
              isoforms of overlapping sense and antisense transcripts, the
              majority of which are unannotated. Some of these transcripts
              follow the canonical splicing rules, whereas others combine the
              exons of different genes or represent other types of noncanonical
              transcripts. These results have important implications concerning
              the correlation of genotypes to phenotypes, the regulation of

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: A new hidden Markov model method (SAM-T98) for
              finding remote homologs of protein sequences is described and
              evaluated. The method begins with a single target sequence and
              iteratively builds a hidden Markov model (HMM) from the sequence
              and homologs found using the HMM for database search. SAM-T98 is
              also used to construct model libraries automatically from
              sequences in structural databases. METHODS: We evaluate the
              SAM-T98 method with four datasets. Three of the test sets are
              fold-recognition tests, where the correct answers are determined
              by structural similarity. The fourth uses a curated database. The
              method is compared against WU-BLASTP and against DOUBLE-BLAST, a
              two-step method similar to ISS, but using BLAST instead of FASTA.
              RESULTS: SAM-T98 had the fewest errors in all tests-dramatically
              so for the fold-recognition tests. At the minimum-error point on
              the SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins)-domains test,
              SAM-T98 got 880 true positives and 68 false positives,
              DOUBLE-BLAST got 533 true positives with 71 false positives, and
              WU-BLASTP got 353 true positives with 24 false positives. The
              method is optimized to recognize superfamilies, and would require
              parameter adjustment to be used to find family or fold
              relationships. One key to the performance of the HMM method is a
              new score-normalization technique that compares the score to the
              score with a reversed model rather than to a uniform null model.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: For many RNA molecules, secondary structure rather
              than primary sequence is the evolutionarily conserved feature. No
              programs have yet been published that allow searching a sequence
              database for homologs of a single RNA molecule on the basis of
              secondary structure. RESULTS: We have developed a program,
              RSEARCH, that takes a single RNA sequence with its secondary
              structure and utilizes a local alignment algorithm to search a
              database for homologous RNAs. For this purpose, we have developed
              a series of base pair and single nucleotide substitution matrices
              for RNA sequences called RIBOSUM matrices. RSEARCH reports the
              statistical confidence for each hit as well as the structural
              alignment of the hit. We show several examples in which RSEARCH
              outperforms the primary sequence search programs BLAST and
              SSEARCH. The primary drawback of the program is that it is slow.
              The C code for RSEARCH is freely available from our lab's

              prediction of a well-ordered folding sequence (WFS) in genomic
              sequences is very helpful in the determination of local RNA
              elements with structure-dependent functions in mRNAs. RESULTS: In
              this study, the quality of local WFS is assessed by the energy
              difference (E(diff)) between the free energies of the global
              minimal structure folded in the segment and its corresponding
              optimal restrained structure (ORS). The ORS is an optimal
              structure under the condition in which none of the base-pairs in
              the global minimal structure is allowed to form. Those WFSs in
              HIV-1 mRNA, various ferritin mRNAs and genomic sequences

              shown to inhibit RNAi in vertebrate cells. Here, we present
              evidence demonstrating that the highly structured approximately
              160-nucleotide adenoviral VA1 noncoding RNA can inhibit RNAi at
              physiological levels of expression. VA1, which is expressed at

              RNAi induced by short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or human microRNA
              precursors but did not affect RNAi induced by artificial short

              inhibition of Dicer function by direct binding of Dicer.
              Together, these data argue that adenovirus infection can result

              of studies aiming to elucidate genome function. The increasing
              availability of genomic sequences from multiple vertebrates is
              creating the need for computational methods that can detect
              highly conserved regions in a robust fashion. Towards that end,
              we are developing approaches for identifying sequences that are
              conserved across multiple species; we call these ``Multi-species
              Conserved Sequences'' (or MCSs). Here we report two strategies
              for MCS identification, demonstrating their ability to detect
              virtually all known actively conserved sequences (specifically,
              coding sequences) but very little neutrally evolving sequence
              (specifically, ancestral repeats). Importantly, we find that a
              substantial fraction of the bases within MCSs (approximately
              70\%) resides within non-coding regions; thus, the majority of
              sequences conserved across multiple vertebrate species has no
              known function. Initial characterization of these MCSs has
              revealed sequences that correspond to clusters of transcription
              factor-binding sites, non-coding RNA transcripts, and other
              candidate functional elements. Finally, the ability to detect
              MCSs represents a valuable metric for assessing the relative
              contribution of a species' sequence to identifying genomic
              regions of interest, and our results indicate that the currently
              available genome sequences are insufficient for the comprehensive
              identification of MCSs in the human genome.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Genomes from all organisms known to date express two
              types of RNA molecules: messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which are
              translated into proteins, and non-messenger RNAs, which function
              at the RNA level and do not serve as templates for translation.
              RESULTS: We have generated a specialized cDNA library from
              Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate the population of small
              non-messenger RNAs (snmRNAs) sized 50-500 nt in a plant. From
              this library, we identified 140 candidates for novel snmRNAs and
              investigated their expression, abundance, and developmental
              regulation. Based on conserved sequence and structure motifs, 104
              snmRNA species can be assigned to novel members of known classes
              of RNAs (designated Class I snmRNAs), namely, small nucleolar
              RNAs (snoRNAs), 7SL RNA, U snRNAs, as well as a tRNA-like RNA.
              For the first time, 39 novel members of H/ACA box snoRNAs could
              be identified in a plant species. Of the remaining 36 snmRNA
              candidates (designated Class II snmRNAs), no sequence or
              structure motifs were present that would enable an assignment to
              a known class of RNAs. These RNAs were classified based on their
              location on the A. thaliana genome. From these, 29 snmRNA species
              located to intergenic regions, 3 located to intronic sequences of
              protein coding genes, and 4 snmRNA candidates were derived from
              annotated open reading frames. Surprisingly, 15 of the Class II
              snmRNA candidates were shown to be tissue-specifically expressed,
              while 12 are encoded by the mitochondrial or chloroplast genome.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our study has identified 140 novel candidates for
              small non-messenger RNA species in the plant A. thaliana and
              thereby sets the stage for their functional analysis.",

              1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluene

              primarily reflects improvement for three sequences that are
              predicted with <40\% accuracy on the basis of energetics alone.
              For these sequences, inclusion of chemical modification

              eukaryotes and complex genetic phenomena like RNA interference,
              co-suppression, transgene silencing, imprinting, methylation, and
              possibly position-effect variegation and transvection, all
              involve intersecting pathways based on or connected to RNA

              that intronic and other non-coding RNAs have evolved to comprise
              a second tier of gene expression in eukaryotes, which enables the
              integration and networking of complex suites of gene activity.
              Although proteins are the fundamental effectors of cellular
              function, the basis of eukaryotic complexity and phenotypic
              variation may lie primarily in a control architecture composed of

              normally flows from DNA to RNA to protein. As a consequence it
              has been generally assumed that genes generally code for
              proteins, and that proteins fulfil not only most structural and
              catalytic but also most regulatory functions, in all cells, from
              microbes to mammals. However, the latter may not be the case in
              complex organisms. A number of startling observations about the

              higher eukaryotes and the range of genetic and epigenetic
              phenomena that are RNA-directed suggests that the traditional
              view of the structure of genetic regulatory systems in animals

              architecture, mRNA turnover and the developmental timing of
              protein expression, and may also regulate transcription and
              alternative splicing. This paper re-examines the available

              referred to as SAL) and the genome of the close outgroup

              The 394 sequences in ECO that do not occur in SAL contain 1350

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21 to approximately
              25-nucleotides (nt) long and interact with mRNAs to trigger
              either translational repression or RNA cleavage through RNA
              interference (RNAi), depending on the degree of complementarity
              with the target mRNAs. Our recent study has shown that HIV-1 nef
              dsRNA from AIDS patients who are long-term non-progressors
              (LTNPs) inhibited the transcription of HIV-1. RESULTS: Here, we
              show the possibility that nef-derived miRNAs are produced in
              HIV-1 persistently infected cells. Furthermore, nef short hairpin
              RNA (shRNA) that corresponded to a predicted nef miRNA
              (approximately 25 nt, miR-N367) can block HIV-1 Nef expression in
              vitro and the suppression by shRNA/miR-N367 would be related with
              low viremia in an LTNP (15-2-2). In the 15-2-2 model mice, the
              weight loss, which may be rendered by nef was also inhibited by
              shRNA/miR-N367 corresponding to suppression of nef expression in
              vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that nef/U3 miRNAs produced
              in HIV-1-infected cells may suppress both Nef function and HIV-1
              virulence through the RNAi pathway.",

  author   = "Pavesi, G and Mauri, G and Stefani, M and Pesole, G",
  abstract = "The recent interest sparked due to the discovery of a variety of
              functions for non-coding RNA molecules has highlighted the need
              for suitable tools for the analysis and the comparison of RNA
              sequences. Many trans-acting non-coding RNA genes and cis-acting
              RNA regulatory elements present motifs, conserved both in
              structure and sequence, that can be hardly detected by primary
              sequence analysis alone. We present an algorithm that takes as
              input a set of unaligned RNA sequences expected to share a common
              motif, and outputs the regions that are most conserved throughout
              the sequences, according to a similarity measure that takes into
              account both the sequence of the regions and the secondary
              structure they can form according to base-pairing and
              thermodynamic rules. Only a single parameter is needed as input,
              which denotes the number of distinct hairpins the motif has to
              contain. No further constraints on the size, number and position
              of the single elements comprising the motif are required. The
              algorithm can be split into two parts: first, it extracts from
              each input sequence a set of candidate regions whose predicted
              optimal secondary structure contains the number of hairpins given
              as input. Then, the regions selected are compared with each other
              to find the groups of most similar ones, formed by a region taken
              from each sequence. To avoid exhaustive enumeration of the search
              space and to reduce the execution time, a greedy heuristic is
              introduced for this task. We present different experiments, which
              show that the algorithm is capable of characterizing and
              discovering known regulatory motifs in mRNA like the iron
              responsive element (IRE) and selenocysteine insertion sequence

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Several results in the literature suggest that
              biologically interesting RNAs have secondary structures that are
              more stable than expected by chance. Based on these observations,
              we developed a scanning algorithm for detecting noncoding RNA
              genes in genome sequences, using a fully probabilistic version of
              the Zuker minimum-energy folding algorithm. RESULTS: Preliminary
              results were encouraging, but certain anomalies led us to do a
              carefully controlled investigation of this class of methods.
              Ultimately, our results argue that for the probabilistic model
              there is indeed a statistical effect, but it comes mostly from
              local base-composition bias and not from RNA secondary structure.
              For the thermodynamic implementation (which evaluates statistical
              significance by doing Monte Carlo shuffling in fixed-length
              sequence windows, thus eliminating the base-composition effect)
              the signals for noncoding RNAs are still usually
              indistinguishable from noise, especially when certain statistical
              artifacts resulting from local base-composition inhomogeneity are
              taken into account. We conclude that although a distinct, stable
              secondary structure is undoubtedly important in most noncoding
              RNAs, the stability of most noncoding RNA secondary structures is
              not sufficiently different from the predicted stability of a
              random sequence to be useful as a general genefinding approach.",

  abstract = "Some genes produce noncoding transcripts that function directly
              as structural, regulatory, or even catalytic RNAs [1, 2]. Unlike
              protein-coding genes, which can be detected as open reading
              frames with distinctive statistical biases, noncoding RNA (ncRNA)
              gene sequences have no obvious inherent statistical biases [3].
              Thus, genome sequence analyses reveal novel protein-coding genes,
              but any novel ncRNA genes remain invisible. Here, we describe a
              computational comparative genomic screen for ncRNA genes. The key
              idea is to distinguish conserved RNA secondary structures from a
              background of other conserved sequences using probabilistic
              models of expected mutational patterns in pairwise sequence

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Noncoding RNA genes produce transcripts that exert
              their function without ever producing proteins. Noncoding RNA
              gene sequences do not have strong statistical signals, unlike
              protein coding genes. A reliable general purpose computational
              genefinder for noncoding RNA genes has been elusive. RESULTS: We
              describe a comparative sequence analysis algorithm for detecting
              novel structural RNA genes. The key idea is to test the pattern
              of substitutions observed in a pairwise alignment of two
              homologous sequences. A conserved coding region tends to show a
              pattern of synonymous substitutions, whereas a conserved
              structural RNA tends to show a pattern of compensatory mutations
              consistent with some base-paired secondary structure. We
              formalize this intuition using three probabilistic
              ``pair-grammars'': a pair stochastic context free grammar
              modeling alignments constrained by structural RNA evolution, a
              pair hidden Markov model modeling alignments constrained by
              coding sequence evolution, and a pair hidden Markov model
              modeling a null hypothesis of position-independent evolution.
              Given an input pairwise sequence alignment (e.g. from a BLASTN
              comparison of two related genomes) we classify the alignment into
              the coding, RNA, or null class according to the posterior
              probability of each class. CONCLUSIONS: We have implemented this
              approach as a program, QRNA, which we consider to be a prototype
              structural noncoding RNA genefinder. Tests suggest that this
              approach detects noncoding RNA genes with a fair degree of
              reliability.",

  title    = "Evolutionary models for insertions and deletions in a
              probabilistic modeling framework",
  author   = "Rivas, E",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Probabilistic models for sequence comparison (such as
              hidden Markov models and pair hidden Markov models for proteins
              and mRNAs, or their context-free grammar counterparts for
              structural RNAs) often assume a fixed degree of divergence.
              Ideally we would like these models to be conditional on
              evolutionary divergence time. Probabilistic models of
              substitution events are well established, but there has not been
              a completely satisfactory theoretical framework for modeling
              insertion and deletion events. RESULTS: I have developed a method
              for extending standard Markov substitution models to include gap
              characters, and another method for the evolution of state
              transition probabilities in a probabilistic model. These methods
              use instantaneous rate matrices in a way that is more general
              than those used for substitution processes, and are sufficient to
              provide time-dependent models for standard linear and affine gap
              penalties, respectively. Given a probabilistic model, we can make
              all of its emission probabilities (including gap characters) and
              all its transition probabilities conditional on a chosen
              divergence time. To do this, we only need to know the parameters
              of the model at one particular divergence time instance, as well
              as the parameters of the model at the two extremes of zero and
              infinite divergence. I have implemented these methods in a new
              generation of the RNA genefinder QRNA (eQRNA). CONCLUSION: These
              methods can be applied to incorporate evolutionary models of
              insertions and deletions into any hidden Markov model or
              stochastic context-free grammar, in a pair or profile form, for

              and with good sensitivity (available at http://bio.cse.psu.edu/
              since May 2001). Alignments are computed between a contiguous
              reference sequence and one or more secondary sequences, which can
              be finished or draft sequence. The outputs include a stacked set
              of percent identity plots, called a MultiPip, comparing the
              reference sequence with subsequent sequences, and a
              nucleotide-level multiple alignment. New tools are provided to
              search MultiPipMaker output for conserved matches to a
              user-specified pattern and for conserved matches to position
              weight matrices that describe transcription factor binding sites

              to identify candidate regulatory regions in WNT2 and then
              demonstrate by transfection assays that they are functional.
              Analysis of the alignments also confirms the phylogenetic
              inference that horses are more closely related to cats than to

              in vertebrate genomes, using genome-wide multiple alignments of
              five vertebrate species (human, mouse, rat, chicken, and Fugu
              rubripes). Parallel searches have been performed with multiple
              alignments of four insect species (three species of Drosophila
              and Anopheles gambiae), two species of Caenorhabditis, and seven
              species of Saccharomyces. Conserved elements were identified with
              a computer program called phastCons, which is based on a
              two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM). PhastCons
              works by fitting a phylo-HMM to the data by maximum likelihood,
              subject to constraints designed to calibrate the model across
              species groups, and then predicting conserved elements based on
              this model. The predicted elements cover roughly 3\%-8\% of the
              human genome (depending on the details of the calibration
              procedure) and substantially higher fractions of the more compact
              Drosophila melanogaster (37\%-53\%), Caenorhabditis elegans

              From yeasts to vertebrates, in order of increasing genome size
              and general biological complexity, increasing fractions of
              conserved bases are found to lie outside of the exons of known
              protein-coding genes. In all groups, the most highly conserved
              elements (HCEs), by log-odds score, are hundreds or thousands of
              bases long. These elements share certain properties with
              ultraconserved elements, but they tend to be longer and less
              perfectly conserved, and they overlap genes of somewhat different
              functional categories. In vertebrates, HCEs are associated with
              the 3' UTRs of regulatory genes, stable gene deserts, and
              megabase-sized regions rich in moderately conserved noncoding
              sequences. Noncoding HCEs also show strong statistical evidence

              elegans diverged from a common ancestor roughly 100 million years
              ago and yet are almost indistinguishable by eye. They have the
              same chromosome number and genome sizes, and they occupy the same
              ecological niche. To explore the basis for this striking
              conservation of structure and function, we have sequenced the C.
              briggsae genome to a high-quality draft stage and compared it to
              the finished C. elegans sequence. We predict approximately 19,500
              protein-coding genes in the C. briggsae genome, roughly the same
              as in C. elegans. Of these, 12,200 have clear C. elegans
              orthologs, a further 6,500 have one or more clearly detectable C.
              elegans homologs, and approximately 800 C. briggsae genes have no
              detectable matches in C. elegans. Almost all of the noncoding
              RNAs (ncRNAs) known are shared between the two species. The two
              genomes exhibit extensive colinearity, and the rate of divergence
              appears to be higher in the chromosomal arms than in the centers.
              Operons, a distinctive feature of C. elegans, are highly
              conserved in C. briggsae, with the arrangement of genes being
              preserved in 96\% of cases. The difference in size between the C.
              briggsae (estimated at approximately 104 Mbp) and C. elegans
              (100.3 Mbp) genomes is almost entirely due to repetitive
              sequence, which accounts for 22.4\% of the C. briggsae genome in
              contrast to 16.5\% of the C. elegans genome. Few, if any, repeat
              families are shared, suggesting that most were acquired after the
              two species diverged or are undergoing rapid evolution.
              Coclustering the C. elegans and C. briggsae proteins reveals
              2,169 protein families of two or more members. Most of these are
              shared between the two species, but some appear to be expanding
              or contracting, and there seem to be as many as several hundred
              novel C. briggsae gene families. The C. briggsae draft sequence
              will greatly improve the annotation of the C. elegans genome.
              Based on similarity to C. briggsae, we found strong evidence for
              1,300 new C. elegans genes. In addition, comparisons of the two

              manner, oligomers bind up to 1000-fold more tightly adjacent to
              the hairpin stem than predicted for binding to a free tetramer at
              37 degrees C. For the interface (/) in [formula: see text]
              additional free energy change, delta delta G 37 degrees, for
              binding is roughly the nearest-neighbor delta G 37 degrees for
              propagation of an uninterrupted helix of equivalent sequence,
              CGGC. When X and Z are omitted, the delta delta 37 degrees is
              even more favorable by approximately 1 kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.184J).

              efficacy of most anticancer treatments, and identification of
              major mechanisms remains a key to solve this challenging issue.
              Here, we highlight the multifaceted senescence-associated
              secretory phenotype (SASP), which comprises numerous soluble
              factors including amphiregulin (AREG). Production of AREG is
              triggered by DNA damage to stromal cells, which passively enter
              senescence in the tumor microenvironment (TME), a process that
              remarkably enhances cancer malignancy including acquired
              resistance mediated by EGFR. Furthermore, paracrine AREG induces
              programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) expression in recipient
              cancer cells and creates an immunosuppressive TME via immune
              checkpoint activation against cytotoxic lymphocytes. Targeting
              AREG not only minimized chemoresistance of cancer cells, but also
              restored immunocompetency when combined with classical
              chemotherapy in humanized animals. Our study underscores the
              potential of in vivo SASP in driving the TME-mediated drug
              resistance and shaping an immunosuppressive niche, and provides
              the proof of principle of targeting major SASP factors to improve
              therapeutic outcome in cancer medicine, the success of which can

               ultraviolet and infrared energy cutoffs. An analogue of this
               effect in Weyl superfluid $^3$He-A is the logarithmic divergence
               of the bending energy of the orbital anisotropy axis at low

               in superfluid helium using a new design of resonators reaching
               unprecedented resolution. The model accounts for diffraction,
               geometrical misalignments and flow through the cavity. It is
               validated against simulations and experiments using cavities of
               aspect ratio of the order of unity operated up to their
               20$^\{th\}$ resonance in superfluid helium. An important result
               is that resonators can be optimized to selectively sense the
               quantum vortex density carried by the throughflow -- as
               customarily done in the literature -- or alternatively to sense
               the mean velocity of this throughflow. Two velocity probing
               methods are proposed, one taking advantage of geometrical
               misalignements between the tweezers plates, and another one by
               driving the resonator non-linearly, beyond a threshold entailing
               the self-sustainment of a vortex tangle within the cavity.After
               reviewing several methods, a new mathematical treatment of the
               resonant signal is proposed, to properly separate the quantum
               vorticity from the parasitic signals arising for instance from
               temperature and pressure drift. This so-called

              Second, using a heterologous expression system, we demonstrate

              via the non-template strand with the identity of the two
              conserved junction nucleotides (-12T and -11A) being of paramount
              importance. A modified promoter consensus sequence identified
              these two nucleotides as among only four (underlined) that are
              highly conserved, and all four were in the -10 region (CTAcacT

              To explore whether PLK plays a general role as a tumor marker of
              endometrial carcinomas, we examined the expression of PLK mRNA
              and protein in endometrial carcinomas and normal endometrium, and
              analyzed the relationship between PLK protein expression and
              malignant potential. We found that PLK mRNA was expressed in all
              specimens from endometrial carcinoma patients using RT-PCR
              methods, although some specimens from normal endometria were
              negative. Immunohistochemically, most of the PLK was found in the
              cytoplasm (around the nucleus), and partly in the nucleus of
              endometrial carcinoma glands and also secreted tissues from
              endometrial carcinoma glands. PLK was expressed at the basement
              membrane of carcinoma glands and partly expressed in the head

              correlation between percentages of PLK-positive cells and

              the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Ki-67
              was independent of PLK expression. Moreover, we noted that PLK is
              strongly expressed in invading carcinoma cells. PLK expression
              could reflect the degree of malignancy and proliferation in
              endometrial carcinoma. Thus, in addition to being of diagnostic

              with nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (nucleoside
              analogues) remains uncertain. We studied treatment with regimens
              that combined two nucleoside analogues, at least one of which was
              new, with the protease inhibitor nelfinavir, the nonnucleoside
              reverse-transcriptase inhibitor efavirenz, or both. METHODS: The
              study included 195 patients who had been treated with nucleoside
              analogues only, and had a plasma HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA level of
              at least 500 copies per milliliter. Patients were randomly
              assigned to receive, in addition to two nucleoside analogues,
              nelfinavir, efavirenz, or nelfinavir plus efavirenz. The primary
              end point was a plasma HIV-1 RNA level of less than 500 copies
              per milliliter at week 16. A secondary end point was the
              composite of the HIV-1 RNA levels measured at weeks 40 and 48.
              RESULTS: At week 16 and at weeks 40 and 48, the proportions of
              patients in whom a plasma HIV-1 RNA level of less than 500 copies
              per milliliter was achieved were, respectively, 81 percent and 74
              percent in the nelfinavir-plus-efavirenz group, 69 percent and 60
              percent in the efavirenz group, and 64 percent and 35 percent in
              the nelfinavir group. Quadruple therapy resulted in a higher rate
              of viral suppression in both the short term (P=0.03) and the long
              term (P=0.001) than did triple therapy with nelfinavir. Triple
              therapy with efavirenz conferred a higher rate of long-term
              suppression than triple therapy with nelfinavir (P=0.004).
              Quadruple therapy also achieved a higher rate of virologic
              suppression than triple therapy with efavirenz (P=0.008).
              CONCLUSIONS: In HIV-infected patients previously treated with
              nucleoside analogues, treatment with nelfinavir plus efavirenz
              and at least one new nucleoside analogue achieves a higher rate
              of viral suppression than do regimens with nucleoside analogues
