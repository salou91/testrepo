  abstract = "The identification of ultraconserved noncoding sequences in
              vertebrates has been associated with developmental regulators and
              DNA-binding proteins. One of the first of these was identified in
              the intergenic region between the Dlx-5 and Dlx-6 genes, members
              of the Dlx/dll homeodomain-containing protein family. In previous
              experiments, we showed that Sonic hedgehog treatment of forebrain
              neural explants results in the activation of Dlx-2 and the novel
              noncoding RNA (ncRNA), Evf-1. In this report, we show that the
              Dlx-5/6 ultraconserved region is transcribed to generate an
              alternatively spliced form of Evf-1, the ncRNA Evf-2. Evf-2
              specifically cooperates with Dlx-2 to increase the
              transcriptional activity of the Dlx-5/6 enhancer in a target and
              homeodomain-specific manner. A stable complex containing the
              Evf-2 ncRNA and the Dlx-2 protein forms in vivo, suggesting that
              the Evf-2 ncRNA activates transcriptional activity by directly
              influencing Dlx-2 activity. These experiments identify a novel
              mechanism whereby transcription is controlled by the cooperative
              actions of an ncRNA and a homeodomain protein. The possibility
              that a subset of vertebrate ultraconserved regions may function
              at both the DNA and RNA level to control key developmental
              regulators may explain why ultraconserved sequences exhibit 90\%
              or more conservation even after 450 million years of vertebrate
              evolution.",

  abstract = "MOTIVATION Comparing the genomes from closely related species
              provides a powerful tool to identify functional elements in a
              reference genome. Many methods have been developed to identify
              conserved sequences across species; however, existing methods
              only model conservation as a decrease in the rate of mutation and
              have ignored selection acting on the pattern of mutations.
              RESULTS We present a new approach that takes advantage of deeply
              sequenced clades to identify evolutionary selection by uncovering
              not only signatures of rate-based conservation but also
              substitution patterns characteristic of sequence undergoing
              natural selection. We describe a new statistical method for
              modeling biased nucleotide substitutions, a learning algorithm
              for inferring site-specific substitution biases directly from
              sequence alignments and a hidden Markov model for detecting
              constrained elements characterized by biased substitutions. We
              show that the new approach can identify significantly more
              degenerate constrained sequences than rate-based methods.
              Applying it to the ENCODE regions, we identify as much as 10.2\%
              of these regions are under selection. AVAILABILITY The algorithms

  abstract = "BACKGROUND Despite increasing interest in the noncoding fraction
              of transcriptomes, the number, species-conservation and
              functions, if any, of many non-protein-coding transcripts remain
              to be discovered. Two extensive long intergenic noncoding RNA
              (ncRNA) transcript catalogues are now available for mouse: over
              3,000 macroRNAs identified by cDNA sequencing, and 1,600 long
              intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) intervals that are predicted
              from chromatin-state maps. Previously we showed that macroRNAs
              tend to be more highly conserved than putatively neutral
              sequence, although only 5\% of bases are predicted as
              constrained. By contrast, over a thousand lincRNAs were reported
              as being highly conserved. This apparent difference may account
              for the surprisingly small fraction (11\%) of transcripts that
              are represented in both catalogues. Here we sought to resolve the
              reported discrepancy between the evolutionary rates for these two
              sets. RESULTS Our analyses reveal lincRNA and macroRNA exon
              sequences to be subject to the same relatively low degree of
              sequence constraint. Nonetheless, our observations are consistent
              with the functionality of a fraction of ncRNA in these sets, with
              up to a quarter of ncRNA exons having evolved significantly
              slower than neighboring neutral sequence. The more
              tissue-specific macroRNAs are enriched in predicted RNA secondary
              structures and thus may often act in trans, whereas the more
              highly and broadly expressed lincRNAs appear more likely to act
              in the cis-regulation of adjacent transcription factor genes.
              CONCLUSIONS Taken together, our results indicate that each of the
              two ncRNA catalogues unevenly and lightly samples the true, much
              larger, ncRNA repertoire of the mouse.",

              Here we present RNAcode, a program to detect coding regions in

              applications not covered by current protein gene-finding

              errors. It uses an explicit statistical model with no machine
