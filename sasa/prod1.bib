              provides a powerful tool to identify functional elements in a
              reference genome. Many methods have been developed to identify
              conserved sequences across species; however, existing methods
              only model conservation as a decrease in the rate of mutation and
              have ignored selection acting on the pattern of mutations.
              RESULTS We present a new approach that takes advantage of deeply
              sequenced clades to identify evolutionary selection by uncovering
              not only signatures of rate-based conservation but also
              substitution patterns characteristic of sequence undergoing
              natural selection. We describe a new statistical method for
              modeling biased nucleotide substitutions, a learning algorithm
              for inferring site-specific substitution biases directly from
              sequence alignments and a hidden Markov model for detecting
              constrained elements characterized by biased substitutions. We
              show that the new approach can identify significantly more
              degenerate constrained sequences than rate-based methods.
              Applying it to the ENCODE regions, we identify as much as 10.2\%
              of these regions are under selection. AVAILABILITY The algorithms
              are implemented in a Java software package, called SiPhy, freely

              primarily attributable to mutational variation and technical
              artifacts rather than selection.",
