              serve in various tissues and organs. This review discusses the
              history, definition, and classification of stem cells. Human
              pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) mainly include embryonic stem cells
              (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Embryonic
              stem cells are derived from the inner cell mass of the embryo.
              Induced pluripotent stem cells are derived from reprogramming
              somatic cells. Pluripotent stem cells have the ability to
              differentiate into cells derived from all three germ layers
              (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm). Adult stem cells can be
              multipotent or unipotent and can produce tissue-specific
              terminally differentiated cells. Stem cells can be used in cell
              therapy to replace and regenerate damaged tissues or organs.",

  abstract = "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNA molecules
              involved in the regulation of gene expression. They are involved
              in the fine-tuning of fundamental biological processes such as
              proliferation, differentiation, survival and apoptosis in many
              cell types. Emerging evidence suggests that miRNAs regulate
              critical pathways involved in stem cell function. Several miRNAs
              have been suggested to target transcripts that directly or
              indirectly coordinate the cell cycle progression of stem cells.
              Moreover, previous studies have shown that altered expression
              levels of miRNAs can contribute to pathological conditions, such
              as cancer, due to the loss of cell cycle regulation. However, the
              precise mechanism underlying miRNA-mediated regulation of cell
              cycle in stem cells is still incompletely understood. In this
              review, we discuss current knowledge of miRNAs regulatory role in
              cell cycle progression of stem cells. We describe how specific
              miRNAs may control cell cycle associated molecules and checkpoints
              in embryonic, somatic and cancer stem cells. We further outline
              how these miRNAs could be regulated to influence cell cycle
              progression in stem cells as a potential clinical application.",
