  abstract     = {Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is one type of the
                  most devastating cerebrovascular diseases worldwide, which
                  causes high morbidity and mortality. However, efficient
                  treatment is still lacking. Stem cell therapy has shown good
                  neuroprotective and neurorestorative effect in ICH and is a
                  promising treatment. In this study, our aim was to review the
                  therapeutic effects, strategies, related mechanisms and safety
                  issues of various types of stem cell for ICH treatment.
                  Numerous studies had demonstrated the therapeutic effects of
                  diverse stem cell types in ICH. The potential mechanisms
                  include tissue repair and replacement, neurotrophy, promotion
                  of neurogenesis and angiogenesis, anti-apoptosis,
                  immunoregulation and anti-inflammation and so forth. The
                  microenvironment of the central nervous system (CNS) can also
                  influence the effects of stem cell therapy. The detailed
                  therapeutic strategies for ICH treatment such as cell type,
                  the number of cells, time window, and the routes of medication
                  delivery, varied greatly among different studies and had not
                  been determined. Moreover, the safety issues of stem cell
                  therapy for ICH should not be ignored. Stem cell therapy
                  showed good therapeutic effect in ICH, making it a promising
                  treatment. However, safety should be carefully evaluated, and
                  more clinical trials are required before stem cell therapy can
                  be extensively applied to clinical use.},

                  and advanced scientific research topic. The development of
                  treatment methods has evoked great expectations. This paper is
                  a review focused on the discovery of different stem cells and
                  the potential therapies based on these cells. The genesis of
                  stem cells is followed by laboratory steps of controlled stem
                  cell culturing and derivation. Quality control and teratoma
                  formation assays are important procedures in assessing the
                  properties of the stem cells tested. Derivation methods and
                  the utilization of culturing media are crucial to set proper
                  environmental conditions for controlled differentiation. Among
                  many types of stem tissue applications, the use of graphene
                  scaffolds and the potential of extracellular vesicle-based
                  therapies require attention due to their versatility. The
                  review is summarized by challenges that stem cell therapy must
                  overcome to be accepted worldwide. A wide variety of
                  possibilities makes this cutting edge therapy a turning point

                  These animals have evolved a remarkable stem cell system. A
                  single pluripotent adult stem cell type ("neoblast") gives
                  rise to the entire range of cell types and organs in the
                  planarian body plan, including a brain, digestive-,
                  excretory-, sensory- and reproductive systems. Neoblasts are
                  abundantly present throughout the mesenchyme and divide
                  continuously. The resulting stream of progenitors and turnover
                  of differentiated cells drive the rapid self-renewal of the
                  entire animal within a matter of weeks. Planarians grow and
                  literally de-grow ("shrink") by the food supply-dependent
                  adjustment of organismal turnover rates, scaling body plan
                  proportions over as much as a 50-fold size range. Their
                  dynamic body architecture further allows astonishing
                  regenerative abilities, including the regeneration of complete
                  and perfectly proportioned animals even from tiny tissue
                  remnants. Planarians as an experimental system, therefore,
                  provide unique opportunities for addressing a spectrum of
                  current problems in stem cell research, including the
                  evolutionary conservation of pluripotency, the dynamic
                  organization of differentiation lineages and the mechanisms
                  underlying organismal stem cell homeostasis. The first part of
                  this review focuses on the molecular biology of neoblasts as
                  pluripotent stem cells. The second part examines the
                  fascinating mechanistic and conceptual challenges posed by a
                  stem cell system that epitomizes a universal design principle
                  of biological systems: the dynamic steady state.},

  abstract     = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNA
                  molecules involved in the regulation of gene expression. They
                  are involved in the fine-tuning of fundamental biological
                  processes such as proliferation, differentiation, survival and
                  apoptosis in many cell types. Emerging evidence suggests that
                  miRNAs regulate critical pathways involved in stem cell
                  function. Several miRNAs have been suggested to target
                  transcripts that directly or indirectly coordinate the cell
                  cycle progression of stem cells. Moreover, previous studies
                  have shown that altered expression levels of miRNAs can
                  contribute to pathological conditions, such as cancer, due to
                  the loss of cell cycle regulation. However, the precise
                  mechanism underlying miRNA-mediated regulation of cell cycle
                  in stem cells is still incompletely understood. In this
                  review, we discuss current knowledge of miRNAs regulatory role
                  in cell cycle progression of stem cells. We describe how
                  specific miRNAs may control cell cycle associated molecules
                  and checkpoints in embryonic, somatic and cancer stem cells.
                  We further outline how these miRNAs could be regulated to
                  influence cell cycle progression in stem cells as a potential
