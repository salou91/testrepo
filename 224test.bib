  abstract     = {The psychopathological analysis of hysteria is a victim of
                  narrow conceptualizations. Among these is the inscription of
                  hysteria in the feminine sphere, about body and sexuality,
                  which incentivized conceptual reductionism. Hysteria has been
                  mainly considered a gendered pathology, almost exclusively
                  female, and it has been associated with cultural and/or
                  religious features over time rather than treated as a
                  psychopathological world. Further, hysteria has been dominated
                  by conceptual inaccuracies and indecision, not only in terms
                  of clinical features but also in terms of its definition. For
                  this reason, it seems necessary to "undress" hysteria from
                  this feminization, sexualization, and corporealization with
                  which it has been abundantly clothed over the years.
                  "Undressing" hysteria will make possible a reconfiguring and
                  deconstructing of the explanatory-causal model of Charcot and
                  Freud. However, if we take out this cultural heritage, the
                  stigma accompanying this diagnosis, and the weight of the
                  enormous historical tradition that hysteria carries, the world
                  of hysteria continues to constitute a domain full of
                  complexity and nosographic challenges. Hysteria has been
                  considered a sum of psychological behaviors and states
                  illustrated by drama, mystery, or falsity. The difficulty in
                  understanding the multiple somatic manifestations which
                  characterize this clinical condition created several
                  controversies and much confusion. In the current nosography,
                  the personological component of hysteria has been separated
                  from its symptomatic manifestation, in the Histrionic
                  Personality Disorder and Conversion Disorder categories,
                  respectively. This segmentation by descriptive nosography does
                  contribute to a unitary understanding of the phenomenon and,
                  consequently, of daily clinical practice. Clinical complexity
                  can be grasped and deciphered only if the symptom is inscribed
                  in the patient's lifeworld and his/her subjective life
                  history. Clinical practice is thus thought of in terms of a
                  structural aggregation of a homogeneous set of phenomena,
                  together constituting a specific way of being in the world.
                  The starting point of this article is the evident modalities
                  characterizing this life-world, taking care not to confuse the
                  point of origin with the point of expression.},

                  Babinski gave a mental basis for hysteria in the place of
                  Charcot's encephalopatic one, and several important semiotic
                  tools to differentiate organic from hysterical manifestations
                  based on studies from 1893-1917/8. His teachings were spread
                  worldwide, and in Brazil they were also appreciated in the
                  work on hysteria by Antonio Austregesilo, the first Brazilian
                  neurology chairman. The neurobiological basis of hysteria
                  conceived by Charcot is nowadays reappraised, and Babinski's
                  neurosemiological contribution is everlasting. The patients
                  believed to be hysterical, and the two outstanding
                  neurologists, Charcot and Babinski, gave support for the

                  the changing ideas about hysteria. METHOD: Study of the
                  literature. RESULTS: In 1870 the interpretation of hysteria
                  put forward by the powerful and influential neurologist
                  Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893) spread from Paris to the whole
                  of France. In the course of time ideas about the aetiology of
                  hysteria were adjusted twice. The clinical symptoms also
                  underwent a metamorphosis and over the years different
                  interpretations of hysteria were accepted by other groups as
                  well. Up till 1870 hysteria had been regarded as a
                  gynaecological illness that affected almost exclusively women;
                  as a result of Charcot's work the illness was transformed into
                  a neurological disorder. However, shortly before his death
                  Charcot had to acknowledge that he had been mistaken and that
                  hysteria was in fact a psychiatric disorder. CONCLUSION: The
                  course of the 19th century nervous disorder ran parallel to
                  Charcot's medical career. After 1885 both had passed their
                  peak. When Charcot died in 1893 hysteria had practically
                  disappeared from French hospitals. The Parisian neurologist
                  had not discovered the illness, he had in fact created it
                  himself.},

                  underlying cause, iron deficiency, is often overlooked.
                  Anaemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality
                  in patients undergoing anaesthesia; however, women are defined
                  as being anaemic at a lower haemoglobin level than men. In
                  this narrative review, we present the history of iron
                  deficiency anaemia and how women's health has often been
                  overlooked. Iron deficiency was first described as 'chlorosis'
                  and a cause of 'hysteria' in women and initial treatment was
                  by iron filings in cold wine. We present data of population
                  screening demonstrating how common iron deficiency is,
                  affecting 12-18\% of apparently 'fit and healthy' women, with
                  the most common cause being heavy menstrual bleeding; both
                  conditions being often unrecognised. We describe a range of
                  symptoms reported by women, that vary from fatigue to brain
                  fog, hair loss and eating ice. We also describe experiments
                  exploring the physical impact of iron deficiency, showing that
                  reduced exercise performance is related to iron deficiency
                  independent of haemoglobin concentration, as well as the
                  impact of iron supplementation in women improving oxygen
                  consumption and fitness. Overall, we demonstrate the need to
                  single out women and investigate iron deficiency rather than
                  accept the dogma of normality and differential treatment; this
                  is to say, the need to change the current standard of care for
                  women undergoing anaesthesia.},

                  hysteria. Using the background of COVID-19, we study past mass
                  hysteria. Negative information which is spread through mass
                  media repetitively can affect public health negatively in the
                  form of nocebo effects and mass hysteria. We argue that mass
                  and digital media in connection with the state may have had
                  adverse consequences during the COVID-19 crisis. The resulting
                  collective hysteria may have contributed to policy errors by
                  governments not in line with health recommendations. While
                  mass hysteria can occur in societies with a minimal state, we
                  show that there exist certain self-corrective mechanisms and
                  limits to the harm inflicted, such as sacrosanct private
                  property rights. However, mass hysteria can be exacerbated and

                  diagnostic categories in psychiatry. Hysteria is a classical
                  term that includes a wide variety of psychopathological
                  states. Ancient Egyptians and Greeks blamed a displaced womb,
                  for many women's afflictions. Several researchers from the
                  18th and 19th centuries studied this theme, namely, Charcot
                  who defined hysteria as a "neurosis" with an organic basis and
                  Sigmund Freud who redefined "neurosis" as a re-experience of
                  past psychological trauma. Histrionic personality disorder
                  (HPD) made its first official appearance in the Diagnostic and
                  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders II (DSM-II) and since
                  the DSM-III, HPD is the only disorder that kept the term
                  derived from the old concept of hysteria. The subject of
                  hysteria has reflected positions about health, religion and
                  relationships between the sexes in the last 4000 years, and
                  the discussion is likely to continue.},

                  Combined with other voice-related changes, it falls under the
                  umbrella diagnosis of dysphonia. Hoarseness has a number of
                  causes, ranging from simple inflammatory processes to less
                  common psychiatric disorders to more serious systemic,
                  neurologic, or cancerous conditions. Medication-induced
                  hoarseness is common and should be considered. The initial
                  evaluation begins with a targeted history and physical
                  examination, while also looking for signs of potential
                  systemic etiologies. Treatment should begin with voice rest,
                  especially avoidance of whispering, and conservative
                  management directed toward a presumptive cause. For example,
                  proton pump inhibitors are appropriate for hoarseness due to
                  reflux, and proper vocal hygiene is recommended for vocal
                  abuse-related indications. In the absence of a clear
                  indication, antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, and proton pump
                  inhibitors should not be used for the empiric treatment of
                  hoarseness. Direct visualization of the larynx and vocal
                  folds, commonly mislabeled as vocal cords, should be performed
                  within three months if an etiology has not been determined or
                  if conservative management has been ineffective. Patients who
                  experience symptoms lasting longer than two weeks and who have
                  risk factors for dysplasia (e.g., tobacco use, heavy alcohol
                  use, hemoptysis) may require earlier laryngoscopic evaluation.
                  Voice therapy is effective for improving voice quality in
                  patients with dysphonia if conservative measures are
                  unsuccessful, and it can also be helpful for prophylaxis in
                  high-risk individuals (e.g., vocalists, public speakers).
                  Surgical management is indicated for laryngeal or vocal fold
                  dysplasia or malignancy, airway obstruction, or benign
                  pathology resistant to conservative treatment.},
