                  (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide
                  unprecedented opportunities for cell therapies against
                  intractable diseases and injuries. Both ESCs and iPSCs are
                  already being used in clinical trials. However, we continue to
                  encounter practical issues that limit their use, including
                  their inherent properties of tumorigenicity, immunogenicity,
                  and heterogeneity. Here, I review two decades of research
                  aimed at overcoming these three difficulties.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, stem cell therapy has become a very promising
                  and advanced scientific research topic. The development of
                  treatment methods has evoked great expectations. This paper is
                  a review focused on the discovery of different stem cells and
                  the potential therapies based on these cells. The genesis of
                  stem cells is followed by laboratory steps of controlled stem
                  cell culturing and derivation. Quality control and teratoma
                  formation assays are important procedures in assessing the
                  properties of the stem cells tested. Derivation methods and
                  the utilization of culturing media are crucial to set proper
                  environmental conditions for controlled differentiation. Among
                  many types of stem tissue applications, the use of graphene
                  scaffolds and the potential of extracellular vesicle-based
                  therapies require attention due to their versatility. The
                  review is summarized by challenges that stem cell therapy must
                  overcome to be accepted worldwide. A wide variety of
                  possibilities makes this cutting edge therapy a turning point
                  in modern medicine, providing hope for untreatable diseases.},

  abstract     = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNA
                  molecules involved in the regulation of gene expression. They
                  are involved in the fine-tuning of fundamental biological
                  processes such as proliferation, differentiation, survival and
                  apoptosis in many cell types. Emerging evidence suggests that
                  miRNAs regulate critical pathways involved in stem cell
                  function. Several miRNAs have been suggested to target
                  transcripts that directly or indirectly coordinate the cell
                  cycle progression of stem cells. Moreover, previous studies
                  have shown that altered expression levels of miRNAs can
                  contribute to pathological conditions, such as cancer, due to
                  the loss of cell cycle regulation. However, the precise
                  mechanism underlying miRNA-mediated regulation of cell cycle
                  in stem cells is still incompletely understood. In this
                  review, we discuss current knowledge of miRNAs regulatory role
                  in cell cycle progression of stem cells. We describe how
                  specific miRNAs may control cell cycle associated molecules
                  and checkpoints in embryonic, somatic and cancer stem cells.
                  We further outline how these miRNAs could be regulated to
                  influence cell cycle progression in stem cells as a potential
                  clinical application.},
