               most devastating cerebrovascular diseases worldwide, which causes
               high morbidity and mortality. However, efficient treatment is
               still lacking. Stem cell therapy has shown good neuroprotective
               and neurorestorative effect in ICH and is a promising treatment.
               In this study, our aim was to review the therapeutic effects,
               strategies, related mechanisms and safety issues of various types
               of stem cell for ICH treatment. Numerous studies had demonstrated
               the therapeutic effects of diverse stem cell types in ICH. The
               potential mechanisms include tissue repair and replacement,
               neurotrophy, promotion of neurogenesis and angiogenesis,
               anti-apoptosis, immunoregulation and anti-inflammation and so
               forth. The microenvironment of the central nervous system (CNS)
               can also influence the effects of stem cell therapy. The detailed
               therapeutic strategies for ICH treatment such as cell type, the
               number of cells, time window, and the routes of medication
               delivery, varied greatly among different studies and had not been
               determined. Moreover, the safety issues of stem cell therapy for
               ICH should not be ignored. Stem cell therapy showed good
               therapeutic effect in ICH, making it a promising treatment.
               However, safety should be carefully evaluated, and more clinical
               trials are required before stem cell therapy can be extensively
               applied to clinical use.",

               differentiate into different types of cells and tissue (potent).
               There are several sources of stem cells with varying potencies.
               Pluripotent cells are embryonic stem cells derived from the inner
               cell mass of the embryo and induced pluripotent cells are formed
               following reprogramming of somatic cells. Pluripotent cells can
               differentiate into tissue from all 3 germ layers (endoderm,
               mesoderm, and ectoderm). Multipotent stem cells may differentiate
               into tissue derived from a single germ layer such as mesenchymal
               stem cells which form adipose tissue, bone, and cartilage.
               Tissue-resident stem cells are oligopotent since they can form
               terminally differentiated cells of a specific tissue. Stem cells
               can be used in cellular therapy to replace damaged cells or to
               regenerate organs. In addition, stem cells have expanded our
               understanding of development as well as the pathogenesis of
               disease. Disease-specific cell lines can also be propagated and
               used in drug development. Despite the significant advances in
               stem cell biology, issues such as ethical controversies with
               embryonic stem cells, tumor formation, and rejection limit their
               utility. However, many of these limitations are being bypassed
               and this could lead to major advances in the management of
               disease. This review is an introduction to the world of stem
               cells and discusses their definition, origin, and classification,
               as well as applications of these cells in regenerative medicine.",

              proliferation, differentiation, survival and apoptosis in many
              cell types. Emerging evidence suggests that miRNAs regulate
              critical pathways involved in stem cell function. Several miRNAs
              have been suggested to target transcripts that directly or
              indirectly coordinate the cell cycle progression of stem cells.
              Moreover, previous studies have shown that altered expression
              levels of miRNAs can contribute to pathological conditions, such
              as cancer, due to the loss of cell cycle regulation. However, the
