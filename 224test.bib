               most devastating cerebrovascular diseases worldwide, which causes
               high morbidity and mortality. However, efficient treatment is
               still lacking. Stem cell therapy has shown good neuroprotective
               and neurorestorative effect in ICH and is a promising treatment.
               In this study, our aim was to review the therapeutic effects,
               strategies, related mechanisms and safety issues of various types
               of stem cell for ICH treatment. Numerous studies had demonstrated
               the therapeutic effects of diverse stem cell types in ICH. The
               potential mechanisms include tissue repair and replacement,
               neurotrophy, promotion of neurogenesis and angiogenesis,
               anti-apoptosis, immunoregulation and anti-inflammation and so
               forth. The microenvironment of the central nervous system (CNS)
               can also influence the effects of stem cell therapy. The detailed
               therapeutic strategies for ICH treatment such as cell type, the
               number of cells, time window, and the routes of medication
               delivery, varied greatly among different studies and had not been
               determined. Moreover, the safety issues of stem cell therapy for
               ICH should not be ignored. Stem cell therapy showed good
               therapeutic effect in ICH, making it a promising treatment.
               However, safety should be carefully evaluated, and more clinical
               trials are required before stem cell therapy can be extensively
               applied to clinical use.",

  abstract = "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNA molecules
              involved in the regulation of gene expression. They are involved
              in the fine-tuning of fundamental biological processes such as
              proliferation, differentiation, survival and apoptosis in many
              cell types. Emerging evidence suggests that miRNAs regulate
              critical pathways involved in stem cell function. Several miRNAs
              have been suggested to target transcripts that directly or
              indirectly coordinate the cell cycle progression of stem cells.
              Moreover, previous studies have shown that altered expression
              levels of miRNAs can contribute to pathological conditions, such
              as cancer, due to the loss of cell cycle regulation. However, the
              precise mechanism underlying miRNA-mediated regulation of cell
              cycle in stem cells is still incompletely understood. In this
              review, we discuss current knowledge of miRNAs regulatory role in
              cell cycle progression of stem cells. We describe how specific
              miRNAs may control cell cycle associated molecules and checkpoints
              in embryonic, somatic and cancer stem cells. We further outline
              how these miRNAs could be regulated to influence cell cycle
              progression in stem cells as a potential clinical application.",
