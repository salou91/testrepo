  abstract     = {Planarians are members of the Platyhelminthes (flatworms).
                  These animals have evolved a remarkable stem cell system. A
                  single pluripotent adult stem cell type ("neoblast") gives
                  rise to the entire range of cell types and organs in the
                  planarian body plan, including a brain, digestive-,
                  excretory-, sensory- and reproductive systems. Neoblasts are
                  abundantly present throughout the mesenchyme and divide
                  continuously. The resulting stream of progenitors and turnover
                  of differentiated cells drive the rapid self-renewal of the
                  entire animal within a matter of weeks. Planarians grow and
                  literally de-grow ("shrink") by the food supply-dependent
                  adjustment of organismal turnover rates, scaling body plan
                  proportions over as much as a 50-fold size range. Their
                  dynamic body architecture further allows astonishing
                  regenerative abilities, including the regeneration of complete
                  and perfectly proportioned animals even from tiny tissue
                  remnants. Planarians as an experimental system, therefore,
                  provide unique opportunities for addressing a spectrum of
                  current problems in stem cell research, including the
                  evolutionary conservation of pluripotency, the dynamic
                  organization of differentiation lineages and the mechanisms
                  underlying organismal stem cell homeostasis. The first part of
                  this review focuses on the molecular biology of neoblasts as
                  pluripotent stem cells. The second part examines the
                  fascinating mechanistic and conceptual challenges posed by a
                  stem cell system that epitomizes a universal design principle
                  of biological systems: the dynamic steady state.},

                  molecules involved in the regulation of gene expression. They

                  processes such as proliferation, differentiation, survival and
                  apoptosis in many cell types. Emerging evidence suggests that
                  miRNAs regulate critical pathways involved in stem cell
                  function. Several miRNAs have been suggested to target
                  transcripts that directly or indirectly coordinate the cell
                  cycle progression of stem cells. Moreover, previous studies
                  have shown that altered expression levels of miRNAs can
                  contribute to pathological conditions, such as cancer, due to
                  the loss of cell cycle regulation. However, the precise
                  mechanism underlying miRNA-mediated regulation of cell cycle
                  in stem cells is still incompletely understood. In this

                  specific miRNAs may control cell cycle associated molecules
                  and checkpoints in embryonic, somatic and cancer stem cells.
                  We further outline how these miRNAs could be regulated to
                  influence cell cycle progression in stem cells as a potential

                  differentiate into different types of cells and tissue
                  (potent). There are several sources of stem cells with varying
                  potencies. Pluripotent cells are embryonic stem cells derived
                  from the inner cell mass of the embryo and induced pluripotent
                  cells are formed following reprogramming of somatic cells.
                  Pluripotent cells can differentiate into tissue from all 3
                  germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm). Multipotent
                  stem cells may differentiate into tissue derived from a single
                  germ layer such as mesenchymal stem cells which form adipose
                  tissue, bone, and cartilage. Tissue-resident stem cells are
                  oligopotent since they can form terminally differentiated
                  cells of a specific tissue. Stem cells can be used in cellular
                  therapy to replace damaged cells or to regenerate organs. In
                  addition, stem cells have expanded our understanding of
                  development as well as the pathogenesis of disease.
                  Disease-specific cell lines can also be propagated and used in

                  treatment is still lacking. Stem cell therapy has shown good

                  therapeutic effects, strategies, related mechanisms and safety
                  issues of various types of stem cell for ICH treatment.
                  Numerous studies had demonstrated the therapeutic effects of
                  diverse stem cell types in ICH. The potential mechanisms
                  include tissue repair and replacement, neurotrophy, promotion

                  immunoregulation and anti-inflammation and so forth. The
                  microenvironment of the central nervous system (CNS) can also

                  showed good therapeutic effect in ICH, making it a promising
                  treatment. However, safety should be carefully evaluated, and
