                  despite optimized statin therapy and may necessitate add-on
                  therapy to reduce this risk. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an
                  omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, lowers plasma triglyceride
                  levels without raising low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
                  levels and has potential beneficial effects on atherosclerotic
                  plaques. Animal studies have shown that EPA reduces levels of
                  pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In clinical trials
                  utilizing a wide spectrum of plaque imaging modalities, EPA
                  has shown beneficial effects on plaque characteristics.
                  Studies of patients with coronary artery disease receiving
                  statin therapy suggest that EPA may decrease plaque
                  vulnerability and prevent plaque progression. EPA also
                  decreased pentraxin-3 and macrophage accumulation. A large,
                  randomized, Japanese study reported that EPA plus a statin
                  resulted in a 19\% relative reduction in major coronary events
                  at 5years versus a statin alone in patients with

                 the details of the clothing and modeling the coherent motions
                 simultaneously. Faced with those difficulties, we address video
                 try-on by proposing a diffusion-based framework named "Tunnel
                 Try-on." The core idea is excavating a "focus tunnel" in the
                 input video that gives close-up shots around the clothing
                 regions. We zoom in on the region in the tunnel to better
                 preserve the fine details of the clothing. To generate coherent
                 motions, we first leverage the Kalman filter to construct
                 smooth crops in the focus tunnel and inject the position
                 embedding of the tunnel into attention layers to improve the
                 continuity of the generated videos. In addition, we develop an
                 environment encoder to extract the context information outside
                 the tunnels as supplementary cues. Equipped with these
                 techniques, Tunnel Try-on keeps the fine details of the
                 clothing and synthesizes stable and smooth videos.
                 Demonstrating significant advancements, Tunnel Try-on could be
                 regarded as the first attempt toward the commercial-level
                 application of virtual try-on in videos.},

                 propose to leverage the pre-trained 2D diffusion model as a
                 bridge to connect the text and material graphs. Specifically,
                 our approach decomposes a shape into a set of segments and
                 designs a segment-controlled diffusion model to synthesize 2D
                 images that are aligned with mesh parts. Based on generated

                 (RS) which aims to detect the semantic changes between the same

                 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based approaches often

                 transformer-based methods are prone to the dominant global

                 Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) requires understanding and

                 kinds of VNFs is time-consuming. It is important to consider
                 transferring the well-profiled VNF knowledge to other
                 lack-profiled VNF types while keeping data private. To this
                 end, this paper proposes a Federated Transfer Component
                 Analysis (FTCA) method between the source and target VNFs. FTCA
                 first trains Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based on
                 the source VNF profiling data, and the trained GANs model is
                 sent to the target VNF domain. Then, FTCA realizes federated

                 less target VNF profiling data, while keeping the raw data

                 data structures that buffer updates and apply them in batches
                 to optimize the amortized cache misses per update. For example,
                 a B\textasciicircumepsilon tree inserts updates as messages at
                 the root. B\textasciicircumepsilon trees only move ("flush")
                 messages when they have total size close to a cache line,
                 optimizing the amount of work done per cache line written.
                 Thus, recently-inserted messages reside at or near the root and
                 are only flushed down the tree after a sufficient number of new
                 messages arrive. Although this lazy approach works well for
                 many operations, some types of updates do not complete until
                 the update message reaches a leaf. For example, deferred
                 queries and secure deletes must flush through all nodes along
                 their root-to-leaf path before taking effect. What happens when
                 we want to service a large number of (say) secure deletes as
                 quickly as possible? Classic techniques leave us with an
                 unsavory choice. On the one hand, we can group the delete
                 messages using a write-optimized approach and move them down
                 the tree lazily. But then many individual deletes may be left
                 incomplete for an extended period of time, as their messages
                 wait to be grouped with a sufficiently large number of related
                 messages. On the other hand, we can ignore cache efficiency and
                 perform a root-to-leaf flush for each delete. This begins work
                 on individual deletes immediately, but harms system throughput.
                 This paper investigates a new framework for efficiently
                 flushing collections of messages from the root to their leaves
                 in a write-optimized data structure. Our goal is to minimize
                 the average time that messages reach the leaves. We give an
                 algorithm that O(1)-approximates the optimal average completion

                 4-approximation algorithm for scheduling parallel tasks for
                 weighted completion time with tree precedence constraints.},

                 Models (LLMs), including RLHF, automated red-teaming, prompt
                 engineering, and infilling, can be cast as sampling from an
                 unnormalized target distribution defined by a given reward or
                 potential function over the full sequence. In this work, we
                 leverage the rich toolkit of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) for
                 these probabilistic inference problems. In particular, we use
                 learned twist functions to estimate the expected future value
                 of the potential at each timestep, which enables us to focus
                 inference-time computation on promising partial sequences. We
                 propose a novel contrastive method for learning the twist
                 functions, and establish connections with the rich literature
                 of soft reinforcement learning. As a complementary application
                 of our twisted SMC framework, we present methods for evaluating
                 the accuracy of language model inference techniques using novel
                 bidirectional SMC bounds on the log partition function. These
                 bounds can be used to estimate the KL divergence between the
                 inference and target distributions in both directions. We apply
                 our inference evaluation techniques to show that twisted SMC is
                 effective for sampling undesirable outputs from a pretrained
                 model (a useful component of harmlessness training and
                 automated red-teaming), generating reviews with varied
                 sentiment, and performing infilling tasks.},

                  2011). Meeting this goal poses significant challenges for

                  particularly for the science practices (Fadel et al., 2007;
                  Duschl \& Gitomer, 1997; Edelson et al., 1999) because there
                  is lack of resources for assessing, monitoring, and
                  scaffolding them. Unless teachers can monitor students
                  individually as they work, it is difficult for them to
                  ascertain where students go awry, particularly if students
                  cannot articulate their difficulties (Aleven \& Koedinger,
                  2000). One way to support teachers is to leverage
                  computer-based learning and assessment environments and
                  augment them with monitoring tools like dashboards (Xhakaj et
