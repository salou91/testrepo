  abstract     = {The psychopathological analysis of hysteria is a victim of
                  narrow conceptualizations. Among these is the inscription of
                  hysteria in the feminine sphere, about body and sexuality,
                  which incentivized conceptual reductionism. Hysteria has been
                  mainly considered a gendered pathology, almost exclusively
                  female, and it has been associated with cultural and/or
                  religious features over time rather than treated as a
                  psychopathological world. Further, hysteria has been dominated
                  by conceptual inaccuracies and indecision, not only in terms
                  of clinical features but also in terms of its definition. For
                  this reason, it seems necessary to "undress" hysteria from
                  this feminization, sexualization, and corporealization with
                  which it has been abundantly clothed over the years.
                  "Undressing" hysteria will make possible a reconfiguring and
                  deconstructing of the explanatory-causal model of Charcot and
                  Freud. However, if we take out this cultural heritage, the
                  stigma accompanying this diagnosis, and the weight of the
                  enormous historical tradition that hysteria carries, the world
                  of hysteria continues to constitute a domain full of
                  complexity and nosographic challenges. Hysteria has been
                  considered a sum of psychological behaviors and states
                  illustrated by drama, mystery, or falsity. The difficulty in
                  understanding the multiple somatic manifestations which
                  characterize this clinical condition created several
                  controversies and much confusion. In the current nosography,
                  the personological component of hysteria has been separated
                  from its symptomatic manifestation, in the Histrionic
                  Personality Disorder and Conversion Disorder categories,
                  respectively. This segmentation by descriptive nosography does
                  contribute to a unitary understanding of the phenomenon and,
                  consequently, of daily clinical practice. Clinical complexity
                  can be grasped and deciphered only if the symptom is inscribed
                  in the patient's lifeworld and his/her subjective life
                  history. Clinical practice is thus thought of in terms of a
                  structural aggregation of a homogeneous set of phenomena,
                  together constituting a specific way of being in the world.
                  The starting point of this article is the evident modalities
                  characterizing this life-world, taking care not to confuse the
                  point of origin with the point of expression.},

                  of hysteria on Babinski's oeuvre, and the conceptions of
                  pithiatism from Babinski until the one of conversion disorder.
                  Babinski gave a mental basis for hysteria in the place of
                  Charcot's encephalopatic one, and several important semiotic
                  tools to differentiate organic from hysterical manifestations
                  based on studies from 1893-1917/8. His teachings were spread
                  worldwide, and in Brazil they were also appreciated in the
                  work on hysteria by Antonio Austregesilo, the first Brazilian
                  neurology chairman. The neurobiological basis of hysteria
                  conceived by Charcot is nowadays reappraised, and Babinski's
                  neurosemiological contribution is everlasting. The patients
                  believed to be hysterical, and the two outstanding
                  neurologists, Charcot and Babinski, gave support for the
                  development of the modern neurology.},
