  abstract     = {Residual cardiovascular (CV) risk remains in some patients
                  despite optimized statin therapy and may necessitate add-on
                  therapy to reduce this risk. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an
                  omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, lowers plasma triglyceride
                  levels without raising low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
                  levels and has potential beneficial effects on atherosclerotic
                  plaques. Animal studies have shown that EPA reduces levels of
                  pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In clinical trials
                  utilizing a wide spectrum of plaque imaging modalities, EPA
                  has shown beneficial effects on plaque characteristics.
                  Studies of patients with coronary artery disease receiving
                  statin therapy suggest that EPA may decrease plaque
                  vulnerability and prevent plaque progression. EPA also
                  decreased pentraxin-3 and macrophage accumulation. A large,
                  randomized, Japanese study reported that EPA plus a statin
                  resulted in a 19\% relative reduction in major coronary events
                  at 5years versus a statin alone in patients with
                  hypercholesterolemia (P=0.011). Icosapent ethyl, a high-purity
                  prescription form of EPA ethyl ester, has been shown to reduce
                  triglyceride levels and markers of atherosclerotic
                  inflammation. Results of an ongoing CV outcomes study will
                  further define the potential clinical benefits of icosapent
                  ethyl in reducing CV risk in high-risk patients receiving
                  statin therapy.},
