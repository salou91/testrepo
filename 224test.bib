               most devastating cerebrovascular diseases worldwide, which causes
               high morbidity and mortality. However, efficient treatment is
               still lacking. Stem cell therapy has shown good neuroprotective
               and neurorestorative effect in ICH and is a promising treatment.
               In this study, our aim was to review the therapeutic effects,
               strategies, related mechanisms and safety issues of various types
               of stem cell for ICH treatment. Numerous studies had demonstrated
               the therapeutic effects of diverse stem cell types in ICH. The
               potential mechanisms include tissue repair and replacement,
               neurotrophy, promotion of neurogenesis and angiogenesis,
               anti-apoptosis, immunoregulation and anti-inflammation and so
               forth. The microenvironment of the central nervous system (CNS)
               can also influence the effects of stem cell therapy. The detailed
               therapeutic strategies for ICH treatment such as cell type, the
               number of cells, time window, and the routes of medication
               delivery, varied greatly among different studies and had not been
               determined. Moreover, the safety issues of stem cell therapy for
               ICH should not be ignored. Stem cell therapy showed good
               therapeutic effect in ICH, making it a promising treatment.
               However, safety should be carefully evaluated, and more clinical
               trials are required before stem cell therapy can be extensively

               including a brain, digestive-, excretory-, sensory- and
               reproductive systems. Neoblasts are abundantly present throughout
               the mesenchyme and divide continuously. The resulting stream of
               progenitors and turnover of differentiated cells drive the rapid
               self-renewal of the entire animal within a matter of weeks.
               Planarians grow and literally de-grow (``shrink'') by the food
               supply-dependent adjustment of organismal turnover rates, scaling
               body plan proportions over as much as a 50-fold size range. Their

               There are several sources of stem cells with varying potencies.
               Pluripotent cells are embryonic stem cells derived from the inner

               stem cells which form adipose tissue, bone, and cartilage.
               Tissue-resident stem cells are oligopotent since they can form
               terminally differentiated cells of a specific tissue. Stem cells
               can be used in cellular therapy to replace damaged cells or to
