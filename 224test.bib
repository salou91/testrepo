  abstract    = {Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task in remote sensing
                 (RS) which aims to detect the semantic changes between the same
                 geographical regions at different time stamps. Existing
                 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based approaches often
                 struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Whereas recent
                 transformer-based methods are prone to the dominant global
                 representation and may limit their capabilities to capture the
                 subtle change regions due to the complexity of the objects in
                 the scene. To address these limitations, we propose an
                 effective Siamese-based framework to encode the semantic
                 changes occurring in the bi-temporal RS images. The main focus
                 of our design is to introduce a change encoder that leverages
                 local and global feature representations to capture both subtle
                 and large change feature information from multi-scale features
                 to precisely estimate the change regions. Our experimental
                 study on two challenging CD datasets reveals the merits of our
                 approach and obtains state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract    = {Write-optimized dictionaries are a class of cache-efficient
                 data structures that buffer updates and apply them in batches
                 to optimize the amortized cache misses per update. For example,
                 a B\textasciicircumepsilon tree inserts updates as messages at
                 the root. B\textasciicircumepsilon trees only move ("flush")
                 messages when they have total size close to a cache line,
                 optimizing the amount of work done per cache line written.
                 Thus, recently-inserted messages reside at or near the root and
                 are only flushed down the tree after a sufficient number of new
                 messages arrive. Although this lazy approach works well for
                 many operations, some types of updates do not complete until
                 the update message reaches a leaf. For example, deferred
                 queries and secure deletes must flush through all nodes along
                 their root-to-leaf path before taking effect. What happens when
                 we want to service a large number of (say) secure deletes as
                 quickly as possible? Classic techniques leave us with an
                 unsavory choice. On the one hand, we can group the delete
                 messages using a write-optimized approach and move them down
                 the tree lazily. But then many individual deletes may be left
                 incomplete for an extended period of time, as their messages
                 wait to be grouped with a sufficiently large number of related
                 messages. On the other hand, we can ignore cache efficiency and
                 perform a root-to-leaf flush for each delete. This begins work
                 on individual deletes immediately, but harms system throughput.
                 This paper investigates a new framework for efficiently
                 flushing collections of messages from the root to their leaves
                 in a write-optimized data structure. Our goal is to minimize
                 the average time that messages reach the leaves. We give an
                 algorithm that O(1)-approximates the optimal average completion
                 time in this model. Along the way, we give a new
                 4-approximation algorithm for scheduling parallel tasks for
                 weighted completion time with tree precedence constraints.},

  abstract     = {PURPOSE: Retroperitoneal squamous cell carcinoma is an
                  extremely rare histological variant of retroperitoneal tumors.
                  The exact etiology and origin of the same is still unknown. To
                  date, only a few case reports have been published in the
                  literature. Due to rarity, standard treatment protocol is not
                  available. The article aims to review the literature and
                  treatment options available for this uncommon entity, based on
                  available data. METHODS: We searched the databases like
                  PubMed, PubMed Central, Scopus, and Google Scholar with the
                  keywords "Squamous cell carcinoma" and "retroperitoneal
                  tumors". Peer-reviewed and recent articles were screened.
                  RESULTS: Seven relevant articles comprising 14 cases were
                  found. Due to the small number of reports, tabulation of
                  treatment details and outcome was done. Like the sarcoma
                  variant, these tumors also present with a large mass in the
                  abdomen and abdominal discomfort. Association with human
                  papillomavirus appears to be the most common factor that gives
                  rise to squamous histology. CONCLUSION: Retroperitoneal SCC is
                  an uncommonly diagnosed entity. Although no specific treatment
                  guidelines exist for this uncommon malignancy; surgery
                  followed by adjuvant or definitive radiotherapy with
                  concurrent chemotherapy (in inoperable cases) seems a feasible
                  option. Multicentre trials should be conducted for
                  establishing definitive treatment strategies for this ailment.},

                  than stratified squamous with gene expression changes that
                  parallel those observed in the pre-malignant squamous to
                  columnar metaplasia known as Barrett's esophagus (BE). GATA4
                  mRNA up-regulation and gene amplification occur in BE and its
                  associated cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), and GATA4
                  gene amplification correlates with poor patient outcomes.
                  Here, we explored the effect of ectopic expression of GATA4 in
                  mature human esophageal squamous epithelial cells. We found
                  that GATA4 expression in esophageal squamous epithelial cells
                  compromised squamous cell marker gene expression and
                  up-regulated expression of the canonical columnar cell
                  cytokeratin KRT8. We observed GATA4 occupancy in the p63,
                  KRT5, and KRT15 promoters, suggesting that GATA4 directly
                  represses expression of squamous epithelial cell marker genes.
                  Finally, we verified GATA4 protein expression in BE and EAC
                  and found that exposure of esophageal squamous epithelial
                  cells to acid and bile, known BE risk factors, induced GATA4
                  mRNA expression. We conclude that GATA4 suppresses expression
                  of genes marking the stratified squamous epithelial cell
                  lineage and that this repressive action by GATA4 may have
                  implications in BE and EAC.},
